*(Last Updated June 2021)*

My name is Sandeep Pawar. I am a Data Science professional, currently working at [Cree Lighting](https://www.creelighting.com/) as Simulation & Data Analytics Engineer. I use engineering simulations, data analytics, Statistics, and Machine Learning to improve products and processes. 

My background is in Mechanical Engineering & Product Development. After graduating with an M.S in Mechanical Engineering, I worked as research engineer focused on using engineering simulation tools  ([Finite Element Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method), [Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://www.simscale.com/docs/simwiki/cfd-computational-fluid-dynamics/what-is-cfd-computational-fluid-dynamics/)) to analyze products. I am co-inventor of 4 patents related to thermal management of lighting fixtures. For 10+ years, I worked in a cross-disciplinary team of engineers to analyze structural and thermal performance of industrial and semiconductor products. I used to design physical tests using [DOE](https://asq.org/quality-resources/design-of-experiments), gather data, analyze it, create simulation models and recommend design changes to the product engineers. Now as a Data Science professional, I do the same thing but with different tools and data.

I pivoted to Data Science ~5 years ago (2016) after I helped solve a business challenge using Statistics and Data Analytics. It energized me so much that I pursued my second Master's in Engineering Management at Northwestern University with focus on Organizational Analytics. I learned how to use analytics to gain business insights.  As an engineer I understand [System Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics) , and hence focus on creating sustainable solutions rather than quick band-aid fixes. 

I am a passionate learner and am always learning something new. I love to challenge myself to learn new techniques, methods, tools and apply them in different settings. The business challenge I mentioned above? I used some of the Statistical methods I had used in my engineering research (Monte Carlo Simulation, uncertainty estimation) to solve it. I was given Employee Recognition Award (twice) for helping solve the issue.  In 2015, I participated in a Business Strategy competition organized by [Navigant Consulting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigant_Consulting). In that competition, the participants were asked to analyze market for a new diabetes drug and advise the company on 'Go-No Go' strategy. I had no prior experience of any of it. I did research on drug markets, how clinical trials work, learned how to create [Complex Real Options](https://hbr.org/2004/03/a-real-world-way-to-manage-real-options), incorporate various risk in drug/financial valuations and presented a business strategy. I won the first prize in that competition. Not bragging, I am just proud of my efforts. One of the judges thought that I had been doing this for many years! I bring the same rigor and passion to all the projects I work on. I may not know everything but you can count on me learning and excelling. I am a proponent of open source and love sharing what I learn.

I enjoy watching cricket and making espressos & latte art. I can make a heart, tulip & rose. Learning to make a swan :) (If you have a favorite coffee blend or local espresso bar, send me a note). Since you asked, my favorite beans are [Epic Espresso by 49th Parallel](https://49thcoffee.com/products/epic-espresso-soe) and favorite cafe is [Espresso Cielo in Santa Monica, CA](https://espressocielo.com/).  I am a die-hard [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar) fan.

 **Volunteering:**
 I volunteer at [Elmhurst Art Museum](https://www.elmhurstartmuseum.org/), a local non-profit that showcases artwork of local and international artists and helps educate local community about art. I help them with their data analytics needs to improve community outreach and marketing. I am always looking for volunteering opportunities so feel free to get in touch with me if I can be of any help.
