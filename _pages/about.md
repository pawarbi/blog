My name is Sandeep Pawar. I am a Simulation & Data Analytics Engineer at [Cree Lighting](https://www.creelighting.com/) where I focus on using computational simulations (FEA, CFD), data analystics, Statistics, Machine Learning to improve products and processses. My primary background is in Mechanical Engineering & Product Development which I use to create insightful data solutions for manufacturing operations. I like challenging myself to learn new things.

I enjoy watching cricket and making espressos & latte art. I can make a heart, tulip & rose. Learning to make a swan :)
