*(Last Updated Dec 2020)*

My name is Sandeep Pawar. I am a Simulation & Data Analytics Engineer at [Cree Lighting](https://www.creelighting.com/) where I focus on using computational engineering simulations ([Finite Element Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method), [Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://www.simscale.com/docs/simwiki/cfd-computational-fluid-dynamics/what-is-cfd-computational-fluid-dynamics/)), data analytics, Statistics, Machine Learning to improve products and processses. 

My primary background is in Mechanical Engineering & Product Development. After graduating with an M.S in Mechanical Engineering, I worked as research engineer focused on using engineering simulation tools to analyze products. I am a co-inventor of 4 patents related to thermal management. For 7 years, I worked in a cross-disciplinary team of engineers to analyze structural and thermal performance of industrial and semiconductor products. I would work with the engineers to design physical experiments using [Design of Experiments](https://asq.org/quality-resources/design-of-experiments) methodology, simulate tests using advanced computational methods, create new computational methods, gather data, analyze it using Statistics, verify/validate/tune simulation results using test data, find insights that other engineers can use to innovate new products, recommend design and process changes etc. Sounds very similar to what a Data Scientist does but with different type of data and tools ! 

I pivoted to Data Science ~4 years ago (2016) after I helped solve a business challenge using Statistics and Data Analytics. It energized me so much that I pursued my second Master's in Engineering Management at Northwestern University with focus on Organizational Analytics. I learned how to use analytics to gain business insights and more importantly innovate. Innovation is brought about by active collaboration, and I love working with teams from different departments, understand the challenges and help create 'solutions'.  As an engineer I understand [System Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics) , and hence focus on creating sustainable solutions rather than quick band-aid fixes. 

I am a passionate learner and am always learning something new. I love to challenge myself to learn new techniques, methods, tools and apply them in different settings. The business challenge I mentioned above? I used the Statistical method I used in my engineering research (Monte Carlo Simulation) to solve it. In 2015 I participated in a Business Strategy competition organized by [Navigant Consulting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigant_Consulting). In that competition, the participants were asked to analyze market for a new diabetes drug and advise the company on 'Go-No Go' strategy. I had no prior experience of any of it. I did research on drug markets, how clinical trials work, learned how to create [Complex Real Options](https://hbr.org/2004/03/a-real-world-way-to-manage-real-options), incorporate various risk in drug/financial valuations and presented a business strategy. I won the first prize in that competition. Not bragging, I am just proud of my efforts. One of the judges thought that I had been doing this for many years! I bring the same rigor and passion to all the projects I work on. I may not know everything but you can count on me learning and excelling.

*Things I am Good At*:
- Analytical Thinking & Research
- Learning
- Collaboration
- Systems Thinking 
- Data Science/Analytics

*Things I am Working on Getting Better At*:
- Programming (I am not a programmer as you may know by now :) )
- Time-management
- Writing blogs and sharing what I learn

I enjoy watching cricket and making espressos & latte art. I can make a heart, tulip & rose. Learning to make a swan :) (If you have a favorite coffee blend or local espresso bar, send me a note). Since you asked, my favorite beans are [Epic Espresso by 49th Parallel](https://49thcoffee.com/products/epic-espresso-soe) and favorite cafe is [Espresso Cielo in Santa Monica, CA](https://espressocielo.com/).  I am a die-hard [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar) fan.
