    "\n",
    "Conditional formatting is not new in Power BI however in August 2022 release a new option was added for [conditionally highlighting data labels](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-my/blog/power-bi-august-2022-feature-summary/#post-20399-_Toc110518262) in charts. It works the exact same way by clicking on the \"fx\" button in formatting options. This opens new way of selectively highlighting data labels by changing colors and color transperancy. I have [written about changing color transperancy](https://pawarbi.github.io/blog/powerbi/dataviz/eda/2021/09/03/color-transperancy-powerbi.html) using HSLA in my previous blog so I will directly show the the DAX and the before/after. \n",

    "In the chart below, I have added conditional formatting to only show values that are above 10%. You can use any complex logic that can be written in DAX."
