    "## Dashboard Graveyard\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have created data analytics dashboards, you must have seen hundreds of dashboards that are created and left unused in workspaces leading to a graveyard of dead dashboards. While there might many reason for this, one of the primary reasons being lack of feedback loop. Often the business requirements change, users change, dashboards may have inaccuracies or they could be lacking usability/accessibility. To overcome this, the developer should set up a feedback loop either formally or informally so the business users can provide timely feedback. Below I show one quick method I use to help my business partners send me a feedback while they are accessing the dashboard. This has worked very well for me because it's less friction to provide feedback since it's right there on the report and it's freestyle (as opposed to forms). Users can submit feedback along with supplemental information.\n",
