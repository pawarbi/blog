    "Generate interview questions based on the following articles. Questions should not be vague. The purpose of the interview is to test interviewee's technical competency and real world experience with using CALCULATE in DAX. Avoid using trick questions. Categorize the questions into 3 levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Expert. Give the interviewee a real world example of Sales analysis for a company that sells umbrellas in US, Vietnam and Brazil. Explain the table, columns and measures briefly and then ask questions based on this example. Don't include answers. Do not ask for anything that is outside these articles.\n",

    "In the initial tests, both Bing and ChatGPT asked questions that were outside the scope of these articles, so I added `Do not ask for anything that is outside these articles` to get a better response. Overall, I think the questions are generic and do like how it it ramped up the complexity from beginner to expert. Note that it is based on the articles I included in the prompt, so the interview questions are not comprehensive, especially the Expert questions. If I added more articles and transcripts using [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) (from SQLBI and non-SQLBI), it might generate more diverese questions. You can also use it to get answers.\n",

    "As with anything GPT, do your own research and use it at your own risk. These LLM models are black-boxes and suffer from [hallucinations](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination) and *will* give incorrect answers. Read [this article](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-hallucinations/) for general guidelines on improving the responses."
