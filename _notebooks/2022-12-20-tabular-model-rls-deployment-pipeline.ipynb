    "## The Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently completed a project where we migrated Analysis Services models to Power BI Premium datasets. Since Power BI datasets are nothing but AS tabular models, it's easy to copy/paste (manually or using C# scripts) tabular model objects such as relationships, measures, calculated columns, hierarchies, RLS roles etc. Everything went smoothly except when we set up deployment pipelines for CI/CD, it failed with an error that gave no clue why it was failing. We created a support ticket with Microsoft but they were stumped as well. They suggested using Large Dataset Format to resolve the error but that did not work. But after several tests, I figured out the issue.  \n",

    "The solution was simple: **Change the Model Permission from `Administrator` to `Read`**. When the object properties were copied, I copied everything along with the associated metadata. For a Power BI dataset, the security roles and access are defined in the service and not in the Power BI dataset. If you keep the Model Permission as `Administrator`, the Power BI dataset still works and refreshs fine but the Deployment Pipeline will fail. Don't ask me how long it took to figure this out!\n",
