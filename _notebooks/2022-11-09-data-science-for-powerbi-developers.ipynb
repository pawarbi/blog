    "\n",
    "I have presented on many topics related to Machine Learning, Data Science, Azure ML, AI Visuals in Power BI but I have always wanted to present how a Power BI developer can use data science in their workflow. The common misconception is that you have to know a ton of Statistics to use data science principles. While it will always help, that's not a requirement to get started. The difference between a BI developer and a data scientist is essentially how they analyze the data to get differrent insights. In this session I show what that approach looks like from a Power BI developer's perspective, common tasks/use cases in data science and how to get started. As a Power BI developer you will be able to enrich your reports with additional insights that you won't otherwise won't without data science.  \n",
