    "\n",
    "I recently completed a project to migrate 45 Power BI reports from analysis services to Power BI Premium datasets. If you have a Power BI file (*.pbix) that's connected to AS instance, and if you don't have access to AS, opening the Power BI file give you an error message below. \n",

    "The solution to this is to use a [PowerShell script](https://powerbi.tips/2020/05/hot-swap-power-bi-report-connections/) developed and shared by [Steve Campbell](https://powerbi.tips/author/steve-campbell/). This script works perfectly. But in my case, I had 45 reports so instead of manually applying the script to 45 reports, I just modified it a bit to strip off the connection, save the pbix and also copy the original pbix files to another folder for backup. **Please note that Steve gets 100% credit for this script**, I merely modified it to suit my purposes. Please [refer to blog](https://powerbi.tips/2020/05/hot-swap-power-bi-report-connections/) for his instructions to use the original script. "

    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save all the pbix files to a folder. Copy the folder path.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawarbi/blog/master/images/ASPBI2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Replace the folder path for `$dir` variable as shown below. Note that the folder path must end with \\\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawarbi/blog/master/images/ASPBI3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the PowerShell\n",
    "\n",
    "4. That's it. If you now go back to the above folder, you will see another folder created called `original_pbix`. This folder has the original pbix files with AS connections. Files in the base folder should now be devoid of AS connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawarbi/blog/master/images/ASPBI4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open the pbix and point to the Power BI dataset. As long as all the column, table, measure names etc are the same as the AS, you should be able to successfully map the report to the Power BI dataset. \n",
