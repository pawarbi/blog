    "It's not uncommon to have a table with hundreds of columns with different column types such as numerical, text, date, percentage etc. You can select columns by using the UI option \"Choose Columns\" and then selecting which columns to keep. But if you have have tens of columns of the same type, you will have to manually go through the list of columns and select the columns to keep. As far as I know, there is no direct way to only keep, for example, numerical columns. In Pandas, you can use `select_dtypes` method and pass which columns to choose based on the data types. No such option or function is available in Power Query. \n",

Here we first obtained the type of the value using `Value.Type` and then compared it with `Number.Type`. Since both match, the result is `TRUE`.

    "While thinking more about ways to make this function better, I actually found two more ways. One is to use `Table.ColumnsofType` ([documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-columnsoftype)) and other is to use `Table.Schema`. `Table.Schema` gives you metadata of the entire table along with the column types. I can use the same approach as above, but just use `Table.Schema` instead to get data type of each column. This is faster, better, cleaner!!! Here is the code: "
