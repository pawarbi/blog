    "\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where you are revisiting one of your old reports or are helping a client optimize their dataset performance. One of the first things you will look at are which of the queries are folding. If the query is folding, Power BI will offload all or part of the transformations back to the datasource thus resulting in faster refreshes. If you just have couple of data sources, you can check it by right clicking or using other methods I described in the video above. But if you have 20-30 queries, which is not uncommon, it will take time. What if there was a quick way so you can prioritize which queries to check ? The functions I wrote below will do exactly that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Value.Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "The function relies on two M functions. `Value.Metadata` which checks if the query is folding. And using `#section` to get list of all the queries. You can read more about `Value.Metadata` on Chris Webb's blog [here](https://blog.crossjoin.co.uk/2016/08/02/another-way-to-check-query-folding-in-power-bipower-query-m-code/). "

In some cases your data source may not support folding and in other query could be folding but `Value.Metadata` may not be able to pick it up. That's just the limitation of the function. You will get the same results in Dataflow where Query Folding indicator is available. "
