    "A quick post on creating random numbers in Power BI. While it's very easy to use, there are couple of things to keep in mind to get correct results. Typically the random numbers aren't needed in Power BI reports but I use them very often for simulations, statsitical functions and synthetic data generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are random numbers? \n",
    "\n",
    "As series of values is said to contain random numbers if all the values have equal probability of occurence and there is no correlation, *i.e.* the numbers are uniformly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to generate random numbers? \n",
    "\n",
    "In DAX, you can use `RAND()` [function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/rand-function-dax) to generate random numbers. Similarly, to generate random numbers *between* two numbers, [use](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/randbetween-function-dax) `RANDBETWEEN()`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Power Query, `List.Random()` creates a list of random numbers, while `Number.Random()` creates a single random number. You can add an index column **before** using the `Number.Random()` to get different random numbers on each row. You can delete the index column after the `Number.Random()` step. There isn't a `List.RandomBetween()` but `Number.RandomBetween()` can be used along with index column to generate numbers between two specified values. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tip 1: DAX and M RandomBetween behave differently\n",
    "\n",
    "If you generate random numbers between (1,100) using DAX `RANDOMBETWEEN(1,100)`, it will generate *integer/whole numbers* between (1,100) and will **include** numbers 1 and 100. In constrast to that, in Power Query `Number.RandomBetween(1,100)` will generate *decimal numbers* between 1 and 100 and will **exclude** 100. Thus, if you are using M and want to include 100, use `Number.RandomBetween(1,101)`.     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tip 2: Multiple Random numbers in Power Query\n",
    "\n",
    "To create multiple columns containing random numbers, add an index column **each** time **before** using the `Number.Random()`. You can delete the columns later.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can alse wrap the table with `Table.Buffer()` to generate different number on each row.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tip 3: You can use RAND() to create decimal random numbers between two numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "As `RANDBETWEEN()` creates integers, you can use `RAND()*N` to create decimal numbers between (0,N). In this case, the numbers **will not include** 0 and N.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to generate decimal random numbers between (N1,N2) use `N2 + RAND() *(N2-N1)`. N1 & N2 are not included.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can divide `RANDBETWEEN()` by 10^i, to create numbers with 'i' decimal digits \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tip 4: IMPORTANT Be careful with using ROUND() with RAND()\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, all random numbers should have equal probability of occurence otherwise it violates the uniform distribution assumption. If you use `ROUND()` with `RAND()` ( e.g.`ROUND(RAND()*50,0)`) to generate integers between 0 and 50, the end numbers will have half the probability of occurence compared to rest of the numbers. This is because numbers greater than or equal to 0.5 will be rounded to the next integer. e.g. 49.25 will be rounded down to 49 whereas 49.68 will be rounded up to 50. Thus, the end values have half the probability of occurence. The correct way is to use `INT()` i.e `INT(RAND()*50)`. While the error resulting from this will be minimal, it's better to use the correct formula when creating synthetic data to avoid bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tip 5: DAX & M do not allow random seed\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python and R, you can specify the seed number to generate reproducible random numbers. Both in DAX & M do not allow seed, so with each refresh new random numbers are generated. In many uses, this is not desirable. A work around for that is to generate random numbers in Power Query using M, indexing those and disabling the refresh for that query. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create an index column and random number column using `Table.FromColumns( { {1..n_samples}, List.Random(n_samples)}, {\"Index\", \"NRandom\"} )`{% endraw %} where n_samples >>> number of random values you need. For example, if you are going to need 3 sets of random numbers 1000 each, use n_samples >> 3000 ,say 5000.\n",
    "  - Uncheck \"Include in report refresh\" for that query \n",
    "  - Now you can use this list by using `FILETR()` in DAX by passing `Table[Index] < 1001` and so forth \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tip 6: Randomly subsample the data by using SAMPLE() in DAX\n",
    "\n",
    "I use this often to check robsutness/sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to the features used. For example, some columns may show correlaton or importance when used entirely but when sub-sampled may or may not. \n",
    "\n",
    "To sample a column, use `SAMPLE(sample_size, 'Table', 'Table'[Column])`\n"
