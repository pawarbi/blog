    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A colleague reached out to me with an interesting problem. He wanted to extract certain error codes/phrases from sentences. He had a list of all possible codes and phrases and wanted it to be dynamic so that he can change the list of possible codes in the future. For example, imagine you survey 10 BI developers on which languages they use on a daily basis. Some might say Python, SQL, R, Excel etc. We have a list of all possible languages and we want to extract only the languages for that developer based on this list. If a language does not exist in the list, it should return a null value. See below what the final solution should look like: \n",

    "\n",
    "I couldn't find a solution online so I created one using List functions in M. All of the steps below can be wrapped into one nice function, but for demonstration purposes I will do it step by step. If you use this solution, just convert it into a function as needed. Also to keep the blog short, I am going to assume that the words/phrases match exactly with those in the list. You will need to format them (uppercase/lowercase/remove punctuations etc.) based on your scenario. \n",
