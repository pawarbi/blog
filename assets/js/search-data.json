            "title": "Introduction to Azure ML SDK",
            "content": "Azure Saturday Hamburg, Feb 20, 2021 . Sandeep Pawar . Twitter : @PawarBI | LinkedIn: in/sanpawar | Blog : PawarBI.com . . Note: This notebook was presented at Azure Saturday Hamburg . Agenda . - Machine Learning Process - As Advertised . Motivation | Demo | . - Glimpse of Real Machine Learning Process - Using Azure ML . What is Azure ML Service | Classes in Azure ML SDK | Workspace | DataOps using Datastore &amp; Datasets | Experiments | Model Deployment | . Motivation . Before I talk about Azure ML, I would like to first provide some motivation for why we want to learn and use Azure ML. . The goal of this presentation is not to show how to create machine learning models but rather, how to use Azure ML to operationalize the machine learning models at scale. I will create an example machine learning model but really the focus is understanding the common &#39;design patterns&#39; in Azure ML. If you are familiar with theory of machine lerning, this presentation/example notebook will help you understand the often neglected MLOps part of ML. If you do not have experience with creating ML models or are new to Python/Azure, focus on the logical process rather than the exact mechanics. You can always revisit this example notebook or Microsoft Learn but hopefully from this session you will understand, at a high-level, how to use Azure ML to deploy ML models in production. . Machine Learning Process - As Advertised . Let&#39;s start with a typical machine learning process. You will see plenty of tutorials on how to create machine learning models. Just type in &quot;Machine learning process&quot; in Google and you will see below results. Most of these describe the process broadly as follows: . Obtain data | Clean data | EDA | Preprocess the data | Build model(s) | Validate the model | Serialize the model | . . Let&#39;s follow this process to build a model. . Data . I will use a dataset from UCI Machine Learning reporsitory called &quot;Bank Marketing Data Set&quot;. You may have seen this in many tutorials. I chose this dataset because the focus of this presentation is learning Azure ML so I wanted to pick something that most can understand and I recently gave a presentation on Machine Learning Model Interpretability using the same dataset. In case you are interested in that topic, you will already be familiar with this dataset after this presentation. . This dataset has 20 features, mix of numerical and categorical features, and a target label with &quot;Yes/No&quot; values. It&#39;s a binary classification problem and the goal is to predict if a customer will sign up for a bank term deposit. Feel free to explore the dataset on your own before proceeding. . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, accuracy_score from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, FunctionTransformer, StandardScaler from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn import metrics from interpret import show from interpret.perf import ROC from sklearn import metrics import seaborn as sns . . print(pd.__version__) . 1.2.1 . Obtain data . There are 32950 observations and 20 features. Each observation describes a potential customer with their details such as job, age, martial status etc. and also the macro economic conditions (employment rate, bond rate etc. when that customer was last contacted. . #https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing path = &quot;https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv&quot; data = pd.read_csv(path) print(data.shape) data.head() .

Clean the data . The column names contain some columns with periods (&#39;.&#39;) in them. We will clean the column names, change dtype of some columns to categoricals and also binarize the target to [1,0] instead of yes/no. . #Define functions to clean the data def clean_col_names(df): df.columns = [col.replace(&#39;.&#39;,&#39;_&#39;) for col in df.columns] return df def clean_dtype(df): cat_cols = [&#39;job&#39;,&#39;marital&#39;,&#39;education&#39;,&#39;default&#39;,&#39;housing&#39;,&#39;loan&#39;,&#39;contact&#39;,&#39;month&#39;,&#39;day_of_week&#39;,&#39;poutcome&#39;] for col in cat_cols: df.loc[:,col] = df[col].astype(&#39;category&#39;) return df def binarize_y(y): y = (y==&#39;yes&#39;).astype(int) return y . #Copy and Clean the data df = data.copy() df = clean_col_names(df) df = clean_dtype(df) df.head(3) . age job marital education default housing loan contact month day_of_week ... campaign pdays previous poutcome emp_var_rate cons_price_idx cons_conf_idx euribor3m nr_employed y . 0 57 | technician | married | high.school | no | no | yes | cellular | may | mon | ... | 1 | 999 | 1 | failure | -1.8 | 92.893 | -46.2 | 1.299 | 5099.1 | no | . 1 55 | unknown | married | unknown | unknown | yes | no | telephone | may | thu | ... | 2 | 999 | 0 | nonexistent | 1.1 | 93.994 | -36.4 | 4.860 | 5191.0 | no | . 2 33 | blue-collar | married | basic.9y | no | no | no | cellular | may | fri | ... | 1 | 999 | 1 | failure | -1.8 | 92.893 | -46.2 | 1.313 | 5099.1 | no | . 3 rows × 21 columns . Split the data . Before conducting the exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will split the data into train and test. EDA should always be performed on the training data only to prevent information leakage, i.e overfitting. Test set should be used for final model evaluation. . Quick note - I have dropped the duration column because based on my analysis explained here, this feature leaks information so I am dropping it. Watch the presentation if you would like to understand how creating interpretable models can help avoid such data leakage. . X = df.drop([&#39;y&#39;,&#39;duration&#39;], axis=1) y = df.y y = binarize_y(y) . cat_cols = [&#39;job&#39;,&#39;marital&#39;,&#39;education&#39;,&#39;default&#39;,&#39;housing&#39;,&#39;loan&#39;,&#39;contact&#39;,&#39;month&#39;,&#39;day_of_week&#39;,&#39;poutcome&#39;] num_cols = list(set(X.columns)-set(cat_cols)) x1,x2, y1,y2 = train_test_split(X,y, stratify=y, train_size=0.80, shuffle=True, random_state = 0) print(&quot;Training set:&quot;,len(x1),&quot; nTest set:&quot;,len(x2)) . Training set: 26360 Test set: 6590 . Training set has 26,360 observations and test has 6590 observations. The 80/20 split is arbitrary at this point. You can create learning curves to figure out how much data you need for training. It will also depend on the algorithm you are using. . x1.head(3) . age job marital education default housing loan contact month day_of_week campaign pdays previous poutcome emp_var_rate cons_price_idx cons_conf_idx euribor3m nr_employed . 23612 55 | technician | divorced | professional.course | unknown | yes | no | cellular | aug | tue | 1 | 999 | 0 | nonexistent | 1.4 | 93.444 | -36.1 | 4.965 | 5228.1 | . 32560 40 | admin. | single | university.degree | no | no | no | telephone | jun | mon | 2 | 999 | 0 | nonexistent | 1.4 | 94.465 | -41.8 | 4.958 | 5228.1 | . 15168 51 | technician | divorced | unknown | unknown | no | no | telephone | jul | fri | 1 | 999 | 0 | nonexistent | 1.4 | 93.918 | -42.7 | 4.962 | 5228.1 | . Exploratory Data Analysis . The data is clean for our demonstration purposes. Before building the model, you should invest significant time in understanding the data first. This is definitely the most important part of building a reliable machine learning model. In this demo, I am going to skip this step and leave it up to you. . #For demonstration, using only few numerical columns and 1000 random observations sns.pairplot(x1[[&#39;emp_var_rate&#39;,&#39;cons_price_idx&#39;,&#39;cons_conf_idx&#39;,&#39;euribor3m&#39;]].sample(1000),diag_kind=&#39;kde&#39;); . print((y1.value_counts(normalize=True))) (y1.value_counts(normalize=True)).plot(kind=&#39;bar&#39;); . 0 0.887936 1 0.112064 Name: y, dtype: float64 . In the bar chart above, 1 is &#39;yes&#39; and 0 is &#39;no&#39;. As you can see, ~89% customers did not sign up for the term deposit and 11% did. Thus, the target labels are not balanced (i.e not ~50/50%). This will affect the model performance metric we choose. For imbalanced dataset, using accuracy as the metric can lead to incorrect results. ROC-AUC is often used in such situations. This is a big topic so for now we just need to know that based on the EDA we see that the target is imbalanced and we will have to keep it in mind when building the model. . Preprocess the data . In the previous steps we split the data and now we are ready to build the ML pipeline. We build the preprocessing pipeline for catgorical and numerical columns using Pipeline() from sklearn. . Categorical columns will be encoded using OneHotEncoder and numerical features will be scaled using StandardScaler. Standard scaler will bring all numerical features to mean = 0 and std dev = 1. There are various ways of encoding and scaling but for demo purposes we will stick with this. . Also note that not all ML algorithms need encoding and scaling. Linear methods such as Logistic Regression do while tree-based algorithms (Random Forest, GBMs) don&#39;t. We will still preprocess the data so we can use the same pipeline for different algirithms, if needed. . #Get column index for each of the columns types cat_nums = [list(x1.columns).index(col) for col in cat_cols] num_nums = [list(x1.columns).index(col) for col in num_cols] . print(cat_nums) print(num_nums) . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13] [14, 0, 15, 12, 11, 10, 17, 16, 18] . #One hot encode cat_ohe_step = (&#39;ohe&#39;, OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;)) #Build Pipeline cat_pipe = Pipeline([cat_ohe_step]) num_pipe = Pipeline([(&#39;std&#39;, StandardScaler())]) transformers = [ (&#39;cat&#39;, cat_pipe, cat_nums), (&#39;num&#39;, num_pipe, num_nums) ] ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=transformers) ct . ColumnTransformer(transformers=[(&#39;cat&#39;, Pipeline(steps=[(&#39;ohe&#39;, OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;, sparse=False))]), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13]), (&#39;num&#39;, Pipeline(steps=[(&#39;std&#39;, StandardScaler())]), [14, 0, 15, 12, 11, 10, 17, 16, 18])]) . Visualize the preprocessing steps: . #Visualize the Preprocessing steps from sklearn import set_config set_config(display=&#39;diagram&#39;) ct . ColumnTransformerColumnTransformer(transformers=[(&#39;cat&#39;, Pipeline(steps=[(&#39;ohe&#39;, OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;, sparse=False))]), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13]), (&#39;num&#39;, Pipeline(steps=[(&#39;std&#39;, StandardScaler())]), [14, 0, 15, 12, 11, 10, 17, 16, 18])]) . cat[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13] . OneHotEncoderOneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;, sparse=False) . num[14, 0, 15, 12, 11, 10, 17, 16, 18] . StandardScalerStandardScaler() . Build the model . I am going to use Random forest algorithm. Random Forest often gives a good baseline performance right out of the box in most scenarios without overfitting. Also, Random Forest has a nice feature - &#39;Out of Bag&#39; (OOB) score. It will help us estimate model performance over multiple bootstrapped samples thus providing a good proxy for cross-validation performance. I am using OOB here, just to save model building time. In a real project, you will carefully construct a CV scheme. . We use the above pipeline of transformations with the Random Forest estimator with default parameters. Set the oob_score=True to get the OOB score. Also, class_weight is set to balanced to mitigate class imbalance. . pipe = Pipeline([ (&#39;ct&#39;, ct), (&#39;rf&#39;, RandomForestClassifier(oob_score=True, random_state=0, class_weight = &#39;balanced&#39;)), ]) #Fit the model pipe.fit(x1,y1) . PipelinePipeline(steps=[(&#39;ct&#39;, ColumnTransformer(transformers=[(&#39;cat&#39;, Pipeline(steps=[(&#39;ohe&#39;, OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;, sparse=False))]), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13]), (&#39;num&#39;, Pipeline(steps=[(&#39;std&#39;, StandardScaler())]), [14, 0, 15, 12, 11, 10, 17, 16, 18])])), (&#39;rf&#39;, RandomForestClassifier(class_weight=&#39;balanced&#39;, oob_score=True, random_state=0))]) . ct: ColumnTransformerColumnTransformer(transformers=[(&#39;cat&#39;, Pipeline(steps=[(&#39;ohe&#39;, OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;, sparse=False))]), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13]), (&#39;num&#39;, Pipeline(steps=[(&#39;std&#39;, StandardScaler())]), [14, 0, 15, 12, 11, 10, 17, 16, 18])]) . cat[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13] . OneHotEncoderOneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;, sparse=False) . num[14, 0, 15, 12, 11, 10, 17, 16, 18] . StandardScalerStandardScaler() . RandomForestClassifierRandomForestClassifier(class_weight=&#39;balanced&#39;, oob_score=True, random_state=0) . Validate the model . #Access the RF estimator from the pipeline rf = pipe[-1] # OOB, by default, gives Accuracy score. This is a slightly imbalanced dataset, # so we will calculate AUC on OOB predictions oob_pred = np.argmax(rf.oob_decision_function_,axis=1) auc1 = metrics.roc_auc_score(y1, oob_pred) print(&quot;OOB AUC is: &quot;,np.round(auc1,2)) print(&quot;OOB AUC on test set is: &quot;,np.round(roc_auc_score(y2, pipe.predict(x2)),2)) . OOB AUC is: 0.63 OOB AUC on test set is: 0.63 . Although the AUC is not very high, OOB gave an excellent estimation of the test score. We are happy with the model and it&#39;s ready to be used for future predictions. . Serialize the Model . Serialize the model using joblib . import joblib joblib.dump(pipe, &#39;baseline_rf.pkl&#39;) . [&#39;baseline_rf.pkl&#39;] . Test the pickle file on the test set again to make sure it&#39;s working as expected. . joblib.load(&#39;baseline_rf.pkl&#39;).predict(x2) . array([0, 0, 1, ..., 0, 0, 0]) . Success ! . We followed the entire process that&#39;s laid out in the &#39;typical&#39; machine learning process. But is that how it works in real life? . The answer is - A Resounding NO. . This is in fact just the fraction of the actual process. In reality it&#39;s very convoluted, non-linear process with multiple stakeholders/teams involved in creating the final model. You have business stakeholders defining the goals and business objectives, IT/Data Engineers who work on extracting/staging the data, Data scientist creating the models, software engineers integrating it with the product and business intelligence developers consuming the predictions in a dashboard. All these teams collaborate with each other, going through many iterations before finalizng a model. . . Ref: https://chapeau.freevariable.com/static/202010/mlops-tube.png . Things that are missing from this &#39;Typical&#39; process are: . Multiple stakeholders and collaborators. Identifying business objectives and tying it to model metric | Computational resources needed to run the ML models. If you are working on a dataset with millions of rows or a DNN model, you will very likely need GPUs | Experimentation design: algorithms, preprocessing steps, feature selection, feature engineering. You will create 1000s of models before identifying few model candidates that meet the business objectives. | Experiment tracking: You will need to efficiently track these 1000s of ML experiments to understand the patterns | Data versioning: You will work with several different versions of the data. By the time you arrive at the final model, the data used for training &amp; evaluating that model will be very different from what you started with. You or your colleagues will need to use a different version of that data for som eother project. | Track model artifacts: Each model will have its dependency requirements, input/output schema, hyper parameters | Package the model: Containerize the model with the dependendencies | Deploy &amp; monitor: scale, data security, performance monitoring, data drift, model interpretability | . This is where Azure Machine Learning Service helps! It&#39;s a fully managed cloud service that lets you: . Work in collaboration while giving control on data security and resources | Scale the compute targets as needed | Track data and model versions | Experiment with thousands of models and keep track of them | Deploy the models based on requirements (real-time, batch, IoT) | Monitor in production | Trace the model back to data and model artificats | DevOps | . Azure ML is a Fully managed MLOPS Platform that will help you manage the machine learning process based on project requirements. . Azure ML Service . Hopefully above example gave you reasons to learn and understand why MLOps is important. With Scikit-learn you can create the models but it won&#39;t help you put those models in production. We will now see how to operationalize this model using Azure ML. . Tour of Azure ML Service . Create a free Azure account by visiting the Azure page: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/ The account is free and you get $200 credit for the first 30 days. Create a &#39;Pay-As-You-Go&#39; subscription so you will incur costs for only the services you use. Be careful of creating compute resources. Shut them down when you are not using them to avoid a costly surprises. If you are a student, you may get some additional benefits. . Create Pay As You Go subscription . Create Azure ML Resource . From MS Docs: A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. Generally, add resources that share the same lifecycle to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group. . The resource group stores metadata about the resources. Therefore, when you specify a location for the resource group, you are specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you may need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region. . . What&#39;s in Azure Resources ? . Ref: https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*2B9p3J0A0efCL2J0.jpg . You can access and manage these resources in Azure ML studio using GUI. Some of these resources can also be managed using Azure ML SDK. As you create machine learning models, you will need to access these resources based on project requirements. The Python sdk will allow you to access them in your notebook on the fly. If the resources don&#39;t exist, you can create them programmatically. . Architecture . Azure ML Python SDK . I highly recommend creating a virtual enviroment that&#39;s specific to Azure ML projects to manage dependencies, especially for Azure Auto ML. Azure AutoML dependencies are often hard to resolve. . . Create a virtual enviroment (e.g evenv) and install Azure ML : pip install --upgrade azureml-sdk[notebooks,automl]. You can read more here . print(&quot;I am working with, Azure ML sdk ver: &quot;,azureml.core.VERSION) . I am working with, Azure ML sdk ver: 1.20.0 . Azure ML Classes . You will use these classes to operationalize the model in Azure ML. This list is defnitely not exchaustive, but 80% of the time you will be working with these classes in Azure ML. I encourage you to read the Microsoft documentation for each of these. . Feature Description Class . Workspace | Foundational resource in the cloud to manage experiments, models | Workspace(..) | . Compute Instance | Fully managed development environment (DVSM) | ComputeInstance(..) | . Compute Cluster | Fully managed multi-node, scaleable compute | ComputeTarget(..) | . Datastore | Azure Data storage | Datastore(..) | . Dataset | Abstracted File or Tabular data stored in Datastore | Dataset(..) | . Experiment | ML Experiment folder | Experiment(..) | . Run | An instance of an experiment with artifacts | Run(..) | . Log | Log metrics, artifacts related to run | Environment(..) | . Environment | Package environment and dependencies | .log(..) | . ScriptRunConfig | Configuration to run experiments | ScriptRunConfig(..) | . Model | Manage, register, deploy models in the cloud | Model(..) | . Webservice | Containerized packages for deployment, Endpoints | Webservice(..) | . Workspace . You may have different workspaces for different teams, projects etc. In fact, it&#39;s recommended to create different resource groups so all the project data, metadata, artifacts remain in that workspace. Especially if you are just trying Azure ML so you can just delete that resource without incurring any charges for any resources in the future. To create or access a workspace, we use Workspace() class. The easiest way is to download the config.json file from the resource group to your working directory. It has all the tenant, subscription information to connect to that workspace. You will be prompted to authenticate your credentials. . . from azureml.core import Workspace print(&quot;Connecting to the Workspace....&quot;, end=&quot;&quot;,sep=&#39; n&#39;) ws = Workspace.from_config() print(&quot; nWorkspacename:&quot;,ws.name, &quot;, nWorkspace location:&quot;, ws.location) . Connecting to the Workspace.... Workspacename: demows , Workspace location: centralus . We are connected to the workspace, now we can access the assets and artifacts in this workspace . Datastore . When the ML resource was created, Azure automatically created and attached a Blob storage to this workspace. That&#39;s the power of managed resources ! You can always attach other Blob, ADLSg2 storage accounts as needed. Let&#39;s access this default datastore. . # List all datastores registered in the current workspace datastores = ws.datastores for name, datastore in datastores.items(): print(name, datastore.datastore_type) . workspacefilestore AzureFile workspaceblobstore AzureBlob . We have two blog storage accounts in this workspace. Let&#39;s conenct to the default datastore. . datastore = ws.get_default_datastore() datastore . { &#34;name&#34;: &#34;workspaceblobstore&#34;, &#34;container_name&#34;: &#34;azureml-blobstore-dca32a5a-2be2-43c0-a924-9f9d9b7c7789&#34;, &#34;account_name&#34;: &#34;demows8142312183&#34;, &#34;protocol&#34;: &#34;https&#34;, &#34;endpoint&#34;: &#34;core.windows.net&#34; } . Remember this is the &#39;datastore&#39;. We haven&#39;t accessed any datasets in this datastore yet. Your data engineering team, for example, can do ETL using ADF, Synapse Analytics, Power Query etc. for you and register a dataset in this datastore.You can also add other datasets to this datastore. We will register the current bank marketing data to this datastore. Once registered, your other team members can access this dataset by just pointing to that dataset. . Dataset . Sometimes you may find it easier to use the GUI in the Azure ML studio to register a dataset. The GUI is more interactive and can also generate dataset profile. . Although it may not seem like a big deal, but being able to register, track, version the datasets seamlessly is one of the most important steps in creating reliable machine lerning models. In the model creation process, you will generate different versions of the data. By versioning and tracking, you will be able to trace which dataset was used for the training the deployed model and thus debug the models in production. . Don&#39;t take my work for it. See what renowned ML researchers, Andrew Ng and Francois Chollet (creator of Tensfor Flow), say about importance of data collection, versioning. Ref . . Following DataOps ptactices will pay rich dividends and avoid many headaches when yu have to debug and re-train models in the future. . The dataset you create in Azure ML is actually an abstraction/reference to the stored data and its metadata (ref). The datasets are lazily evaluated, which means: . No additional storage cost | Data versioning | No risk of changing original data | . Register a dataset . from azureml.core import Dataset from azureml.data.dataset_factory import DataType #First create a dataset object ds1 = Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files(path=path) #Register this dataset to the datastore print(&quot;Registering dataset to the cloud...&quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) ds1 = ds1.register(workspace = ws, name= &quot;bankmarketing&quot;, description = &quot;This is the original data&quot;) print(&quot; n nData registration successful n n&quot;, Dataset.get_all(ws) ) .

We have registered the original dataset to the default datastore. . Create a new version of the dataset . If you noticed in the training data used above, I dropped the duration column. We will create another version of the same dataset ds1 by dropping the duration column and call it ds2. . ds2 = ds1.drop_columns(&#39;duration&#39;) ds2 = ds2.register(workspace = ws, name= &quot;bankmarketing&quot;, description = &quot;Duration column dropped&quot;, create_new_version=True) . Dataset.get_all(ws) . {&#39;bankmarketing&#39;: DatasetRegistration(id=&#39;9980d47e-df35-45ec-972a-b68a8dd64bf6&#39;, name=&#39;bankmarketing&#39;, version=2, description=&#39;Duration column dropped&#39;, tags={})} . Note that we still have only 1 dataset in the Datastore. We just replaced the first dataset with the new version. Notice the version number version=2 above. We can retrieve any version when needed. We have only 1 file in the datastore not 2. This is how, by creating abstraction, we are able to save storage cost. If needed, you can add properties, tags, description to the dataset for future reference. In fact it&#39;s a good practice to do so for tracebility. . By default when you reference a dataset, it will always pull the latest version, unless specified. . We are still not done with the dataset. For training, we cleaned the data and split it into train/test. Those also need to be registered to the datastore. We don&#39;t have to but that&#39;s good DataOps/MLOps practice. Also, anytime you create a cross-validation folds for your final model training/validation, register those in the datastore too for reproducibility. To keep things simple, I am going to upload the train and test data created above to the datastore as one single csv file. Also note that you can directly register a pandas dataframe as a dataset. . #Create one single file with training and testing data #Add a column to label which data is train and test #This way we can keep the data in one single file # Besure sure to drop the &#39;data&#39; columns before training and testing. train = x1.copy() train[&#39;target&#39;] = y1 train[&#39;data&#39;] = &#39;train&#39; test = x2.copy() test[&#39;target&#39;] = y2 test[&#39;data&#39;] = &#39;test&#39; train_test_data = train.append(test) . # Register the pandas dataframe as a dataset # Add tags for traceability from azureml.data.dataset_factory import TabularDatasetFactory ds3 = (TabularDatasetFactory .register_pandas_dataframe( train_test_data, target=(datastore,&#39;bank_train_test&#39;), name=&#39;bank_train_test&#39;, tags = {&#39;Author&#39;:&#39;Sandeep&#39;,&#39;Project&#39;:&#39;Bank Marketing&#39;}, show_progress=True) ) .

Datastore has two datasets now which can be accessed anytime or versioned. . Compute . We can train the model locally and deploy it to the cloud. But if you want to scale-up the process by parallelizing model training, you can use the compute cluster. There two types of compute: . Compute Instance: This is like a managed VM with R,Python, Jupyter installed. You can use it for remote training but can also be accessed from the Studio for development. . | Compute Cluster: This is a scalable multi-node compute, meaning if your training requires lot of compute power (e.g. 12 machines with 24 cores each) you can push the training to the compute cluster to do that. This can also be used for batch-inferencing. . | . For example purposes, I will show how to create it but won&#39;t use it. Compute is expensive. Companies often create compute quota to limit cost and use remote compute for hyperparameter tuning or large jobs. Note that if you are using Azure ML pipelines, you have to use Compute instance/cluster and local training is not available. . I generally prefer creating compute using GUI because you can see the cost of each compute option. . from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute compute_name = &quot;DS12V2&quot; try: vm = ComputeTarget(ws, compute_name) print(f&quot;{compute_name} exists already&quot;) except: compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size=&quot;Standard_D2_V2&quot;, max_nodes=4) vm = ComputeTarget.create(ws, compute_name, compute_config) vm.wait_for_completion(show_output=True) . DS12V2 exists already Running . Experiment . This is the heart of machine learning and where all the magic happens. When you are working on a machine learning project, it&#39;s rarely a linear process as we discussed above. You try many different algorithms, debug them, understand how they work, try different preprocessing steps, feature engineering, data augmentation etc,, which means you will end up creating thousands of models per project. To keep track of all these experimental runs, Azure ML provides the Experiment class. . Think of Experiment() as a big giant folder where you save the model runs and the artifacts associated with that experiment. At the end of your experiment, you will see how each model performed based on selected metric and choose the right model for your project. The steps you will follow for each experimental run: . Create Experiment object | Start run | Log metrics | Get run/experiment details | . Just for demonstration purposes, I will create a Demo Experiment and log values 1,2,3 for metric called demo_metric. . from azureml.core import Experiment exp1 = Experiment(workspace=ws, name=&quot;Demo_Experiment&quot;) exp1 . NameWorkspaceReport PageDocs Page . Demo_Experiment | demows | Link to Azure Machine Learning studio | Link to Documentation | . If you click on the above link, it will take you directly to the Azure ML Studio Experiment page. We will created the Experiment, i.e folder. Now, we run some experiments . #Start run from azureml.widgets import RunDetails demo_run = exp1.start_logging() #Start Logging demo_run.log(&#39;demo_metric&#39; , 1) demo_run.log(&#39;demo_metric&#39; , 2) demo_run.log(&#39;demo_metric&#39; , 3) #Stop logging demo_run.complete() RunDetails(demo_run).show() . Remember to use run.complete() to stop the run. A better and easier way is to use with as follows. When the run is complete, it will be completed automatically. . For the bank marketing project, we created a random forest model using default hyper params. To demonstrate how create experiments, we will train four RF models by changing the max_depth parameter. When max_depth is None, it&#39;s just a stump of a tree. As we grow the depth, features are split and will identify non-linear patterns in the data. We will try max_depth = [None, 5,7,9]. In a real project, you will perform hyperparameter optimization using RandomSearch, Baysian Optimization using SKLearn, HyperOpt, HyperDrive etc. . #Create another experiment called bank from azureml.core import Run #Define new experiment bank = Experiment(workspace=ws, name=&quot;Bank_Marketing&quot;, ) #Define Hyperparameter to tune max_depth=[None,5,7,9] #Run the experiment for depth in max_depth: with bank.start_logging() as run: #snapshot only the snapshot directory snapshot_directory = &#39;snapshot&#39; #Log max_depth run.log(&#39;Model&#39;, &#39;Random Forest&#39;) run.log(&#39;Dataset&#39;, ds_uid) run.log(&#39;max_depth&#39;, int(0 if depth is None else depth)) run.log_list(&quot;input_columns&quot;, list(x1.columns)) #train the pipeline pipe2 = Pipeline([ (&#39;ct&#39;, ct), (&#39;rf&#39;, RandomForestClassifier(oob_score=True, random_state=0, class_weight = &#39;balanced&#39;, max_depth = depth )), ]) pipe2.fit(x1,y1) rf2 = pipe2[-1] #Log model details run.log(&#39;oob_score&#39;, &#39;True&#39;) run.log(&#39;class_weight&#39;, &#39;balanced&#39;) oob_pred2 = np.argmax(rf2.oob_decision_function_,axis=1) auc2 = metrics.roc_auc_score(y1, oob_pred2) #Log metrics run.log(&#39;oob_auc&#39;, auc2) print(&quot;max_depth: &quot;,depth,&quot; , oob_auc: &quot;, np.round(auc2,3)) RunDetails(run).show() . max_depth: None , oob_auc: 0.626 max_depth: 5 , oob_auc: 0.74 max_depth: 7 , oob_auc: 0.746 max_depth: 9 , oob_auc: 0.746 . By increasing the max_depth, AUC increased from 62% to 74% ! . In the experiment above, we logged the model class, dataset used, hyper parameter, input columns, AUC score etc. After the experiment is complete, you can visit the Studio to see the output and/or interact with the model artifacts. . Note that by default, when you create an experiment, Azure ML will take a snapshot of the working folder. See below. Depending on your needs this is a good/bad thing. You may not want to snapshot all the files and folder. You can specify an amlingnore or gitignore file to indicate which files/folders to ignore. Another option is to specify which directory to snapshot. For example, above I specified start_logging(snapshot_directory = &#39;snapshot&#39;) to snapshot the snapshot folder. This helps reproducibility. You can save data, yaml, config files etc so you or your colleagues can reproduce the results months later. The maximum snapshot limit is 300MB. If your directory exceeds that the run will fail. You can increase the limit but you will incur storage costs. Also, directories ./output and ./logs are special. They will always be automatically uploaded as snapshot. . I recommending &#39;snapshotting&#39; only the required model artifacts and specifying which folder to snapshot. . . Model Packaging - (Registration &amp; Deployment) . We ran some experiments with max_depth hyperparameters and found that using max_depth = [5,7,9] will improve the results significantly. Let&#39;s use &#39;one-standard error&#39; rule (Ref: ESL, pp61) to pick a parsomonious model. We will pick max_depth=5 for create a pickle file and deploy it in service. . Model accuracy is not the only metric, in fact it shouldn&#39;t be, to select a model. Focus should be on selecting simple, parsimonious models that are interpretable &amp; explainable. Watch my interpretability presentation for more details. For now, we will assume this is the right model for us. . final_model = Pipeline([ (&#39;ct&#39;, ct), (&#39;rf&#39;, RandomForestClassifier(oob_score=True, random_state=0, class_weight = &#39;balanced&#39;, max_depth = 5)), ]) final_model.fit(x1,y1) joblib.dump(final_model, &#39;bank_model.pkl&#39;) . [&#39;bank_model.pkl&#39;] . test_final_model = joblib.load(&#39;bank_model.pkl&#39;) . test_final_model.predict(x1.iloc[0:]) . array([0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 1]) . print(&quot;AUC on Test set: ,&quot;, np.round(metrics.roc_auc_score(y2, test_final_model.predict(x2)),2)) . AUC on Test set: , 0.74 . Excellent, OOB score is same as the test (very rare!). . There are actually multiple ways to register and deploy a model as webservice. Typically, you will first create training script, register an environment, create inference schema, register model, create deployment config etc. But there is a shorter way to do all of that in one single step. Usually you will go through everything step-by-step but for demonstration purposes, I will roll these steps into one by using ResourceConfiguration class. Also, note that this is for real-time inferencing using Azure Container Instance. You should always deploy the model locally first for debugging, testing before deploying it to the cloud. For batch-inferencing, follow these steps. . You can also register and deploy using the interface in the Studio. . We will also save the sample features and labels for future reference and model debugging. . np.savetxt(&#39;features.csv&#39;, np.array(x1), delimiter=&#39;,&#39;, fmt=&#39;%s&#39;) np.savetxt(&#39;labels.csv&#39;, y1, delimiter=&#39;,&#39;) . datastore.upload_files(files=[&#39;./features.csv&#39;, &#39;./labels.csv&#39;], target_path=&#39;sample_data/&#39;, overwrite=True) input_dataset = Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files(path=[(datastore, &#39;sample_data/features.csv&#39;)]) output_dataset = Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files(path=[(datastore, &#39;sample_data/labels.csv&#39;)]) .

We got the response back with predictions. Service is running and ready for action. If you are trying this example, be sure to delet the service and the weorkspace to avoid charges. . service.delete() . Monitor the Webservice . To monitor the performance of the webservice and the deployed model, we need to do few things: . Stress test the model for distribution shifts and loads | Collect webservice performance metric using Application Insights. This will help us collect: . Responses | Request rates, response time, failure rates | Exceptions | . | Monitor Concept Drift . Performance of the ML model will likely degrade over time due to change in distribution of the input data | By monitoring drift, we can measure the drift and decide when to re-train the model | . | Collect Model Interpretability data during inferencing . This is to track how model is creating predictions and if predictions are fair | . | . This is big topic and will require a separate presentation. But just know that with Azure ML service, you can monitor the model performance in production environment. . Next Steps . This was just the introduction to give you flavor for how to use Azure ML sdk. There are more advanced methods available depending on the project needs. I would encourage you to research those on your own from MS Docs and MS Learn. . Azure ML Pipelines | Azure ML HyperDrive | Azure Auto ML | Azure ML Studio Designer | . Resources .

            "title": "Quantized Discrete Parameter Sampling in AzureML HyperDrive",
            "content": "HyperDrive . Azure ML offers an automated hyperparameter tuning capability at scale using its &#39;HyperDrive&#39; package. The key word here is &#39;at scale&#39;. It works similar to Scikit-Learn&#39;s hyperparameter tuning but HyperDrive can be run on remote compute clusters with multiple nodes to obtain the optimized parameters faster. If your model pipeline has multiple models with different preprocessing steps, you will ikely end up with thousands of parameter combinations. This can take significant amount of time depending on your model pipeline architecture. With HyperDrive, you can submit the run to a managed remote cluster to run all the experiments and obtain the tuned parameters. Depending on the sampling method used, these runs can also be parallelized to run several experiments concurrently. . You can follow this example notebook to learn more about how to setup the HyperDrive experiment. I will share my more complex example hopefully in the next couple of blogs. . Parameter Search Space . The parameter search space can be defined using discrete or continuous distributions. . Discrete parameters are integers or strings (e.g. 1, 50, &#39;liblinear&#39; etc.), while continuous are floats (e.g. 1.2,0.5). You can read more about it here on MS Docs. One of the ways you can define the discrete hyperparameters is by using the quantized continuous distributions. These are the parameter expressions that start with &#39;q&#39;, e.g. quniform(),qloguniform(), qnormal() and qlognormal(). Note that the &#39;q&#39; parameters cannot be used for with GridParameterSampling() and BayesianParameterSampling() only supports quniform(). . Microsoft documentation doesn&#39;t give examples of the search space these &#39;q&#39; parameters create, so I thought I would provide some examples. . 1. quniform . quniform(low, high, q) creates uniform distriution between low and high values, separated by spacing q. For example, to create a discrete distribution of values between (10,30) that are 2 values values apart you would define : . from azureml.train.hyperdrive import normal, uniform, choice, quniform, qloguniform, qnormal, qlognormal import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline import pandas as pd { &quot;param&quot; : quniform(10, 30, 2) } . {&#39;param&#39;: [&#39;quniform&#39;, [10, 30, 2]]} . This is what the search space will look like: . #with q = 2 param = np.sort(np.unique((np.round(np.random.uniform(low = 10, high = 30, size=10)/2)*2))) param . array([12., 18., 22., 28.]) . #with q = 3 param = np.sort(np.unique(np.round(np.random.uniform(low = 10, high = 30, size=10)/3)*3)) print(param) sns.histplot(param, kde=True); . [12. 15. 18. 24. 27. 30.] . As you can see above, qith q=2 the values are spaced apart by 2 values and with q=3, the values are 3 units apart. Note that the values are randomly distributed so you may not see all the values between the specified low and high. You could specify the same search space by using choice(12, 15, 17,27). But if the search space is large, it&#39;s easier to use the quantized version. . 2. qloguniform . Defined as : . { &quot;param&quot; : qloguniform(0.01, 5, 3) } . {&#39;param&#39;: [&#39;qloguniform&#39;, [0.01, 5, 3]]} . #with q = 3 param = np.sort(np.unique(np.round(np.exp(np.random.uniform(0.01,5,30)))/3)*3) print(param) sns.histplot(param, kde=True) . [ 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 7. 9. 10. 11. 17. 18. 19. 37. 47. 50. 57. 59. 102. 141.] . &lt;AxesSubplot:ylabel=&#39;Count&#39;&gt; . 3.qnormal . Values are normally distributed with specified mean and standard deviation. Defined as: . { &quot;param&quot; : qnormal(300,50, 5) } . {&#39;param&#39;: [&#39;qnormal&#39;, [300, 50, 5]]} . #with mean = 300, std = 50, q = 5 param = np.sort(np.unique(np.round((np.random.normal(300,50,50)))/5)*5) print(param) sns.histplot(param, kde=True) . [196. 199. 200. 236. 241. 255. 257. 258. 260. 261. 274. 277. 278. 280. 284. 285. 286. 287. 291. 296. 298. 300. 302. 303. 305. 306. 307. 310. 312. 314. 317. 319. 323. 324. 331. 338. 341. 345. 350. 372. 395.] . &lt;AxesSubplot:ylabel=&#39;Count&#39;&gt; . This would be a good choice for, say n_estimators() in tree-based algorithms. You can always adjust the q parameter to define how close the values can be. . 4. qlognormal . Values are lognormally distributed with the specified mean and standard deviation. . { &quot;param&quot; : qlognormal(10,0.5, 2) } . {&#39;param&#39;: [&#39;qlognormal&#39;, [10, 2, 2]]} . #with mean = 300, std = 50, q = 2 param = np.sort(np.unique(np.round(np.exp(np.random.normal(10,0.5,25))/2)*2)) print(param) sns.histplot(param, kde=True); . [ 7426. 9054. 9668. 10800. 10816. 10886. 12758. 14232. 14346. 14838. 15376. 17612. 18320. 19152. 20512. 22676. 25370. 26078. 26398. 32758. 37050. 41412. 43732. 54636. 58332.] . This would be helpful for creating non-uniform distributin of the parameters that are right-skewed .

While exporting the dataflow by creating a .json file is known, I didn&#39;t find any references on how to fix the Power BI Desktop report to point to the migrated dataflows. In this post I will describe how to do that easily. If you prefer, you can watch the video at the end of the blog post. . Steps: . First and foremost you will need to setup the enterprise data gateway, add the required data sources and authenticate them. Before following any of the steps below, ensure that the gateway is setup correctly and its running. . | In Power BI service, browse to the dataflow you want to export . | Click on the ellipses (three dots) and select Export .json. The json file contains the data and the metadata associated with the dataflow for all the queries within it. . | . . In Power BI service, browse to the second workspace to which you want to migrate the saved dataflow and select Import Model. Import the saved the json file. | . . You will be prompted to Edit Credentials.

            "title": "DAX Formulae For Creating Statistical Distributions in Power BI",
            "content": "Why create statistical distributions? . As a simulation engineer, one of my responsibilities is to create statistical experiments to simulate various scenarios and understand the outcomes. These outcomes have probabilities associated with them which help the decision makers to identify key risks, uncertainties and make informed decisions to leverage risk. For example, if the company wants to invest a million dollars in a capital project, there are many uncertainties involved such as labor costs, scheduling uncertainty, project delays, technical risks etc. A statistical simulation experiment, i.e Monte Carlo simulation, will assign probabilities with these risks and simulate thousands of outcomes to compute the probability of success. The company can then decide if it wants to invest the $1M or what decisions it can take proactively to de-risk the uncertainties. . There are many statistical packages and Excel add-ons available to create such experiments but none that I know of in Power BI. In Power BI, only uniform distribution and normal distributions are available natively in DAX. In this blog post I share the DAX codes I use to create different distibutions. . If you are new to Monte Carlo / Discrete Event simulation, these distributions may not make sense. In a future blog post I will show when to use these distributions and how to create sophisticated simulations in Power BI. The beauty of creating it in Power BI vs Excel is that the stakeholders can interact with the simulation parameters and understand the probable outcomes much more clearly. The DAX codes given here can be used to create calculated tables for simulations. . If you are interested in this topic, please also take a look at my other blog on generating random numbers in Power BI . Uniform Distribution .

This will require you to publish the responses to web. Note that this does not mean the data could be searched via a search engine. But if someone has a link to the published data, they will be able to see it (not edit it) and use it. You can always disable the publishing by clicking Stop Publishing in Publish to Web option. . With this method you can refresh the Power BI dashboard and pull the latest responses from Google Form. . Note that Microsoft has Microsoft Form which is free but as far as I know it does not allow publishing the form response data to web. If you have confidential data, Microsoft Form is a better option as Power BI will need the access to Microsoft Form to be authenticated before importing the data. However, in my case, I was working with a nonprofit organization to analyze their survey responses so Microsoft Form was not an option. For more complex workflows ,and large data, I advise using Microsoft Form, Power Automate and SharePoint together. . Steps . Open the Google Form in edit mode and click on Responses | . Click on View Responses in Sheets | . File &gt; Publish to the Web | . Either create a new sheet or select an existing sheet. | .

            "content": "Power BI recently announced availability of a new license &#39;Premium Per User&#39; which will allow small to medium size companies to access Premium features at a lower price point (as of 12/11/2020 price has not been published) . I was given a priority access to it and have been exploring all the premium features for the last few weeks. One of the key benefits of Premium is the ability to consume published datasets via XMLA endpoint. Instead of me describing it, you can read Microsoft&#39;s documentation for detailed description here. . To use XMLA endpoint, you will need to have a Premium workspace and enable the &#39;XMLA Endpoint&#39; in capacity settings. . Capacity Settings &gt; Power BI Premium &gt; Workloads &gt; XMLA Endpoint . . In this blog post I will show how to setup connection to the XMLA endpoint and access Power BI datasets &amp; measures within those datasets using Python in a Jupyter notebook. This blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook. I use Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualization and building machine learning models. Ability to consume published datasets in a notebook will be immensely helpful in my own workflow. . I took inspiration from David Elderveld&#39;s amazing 4-part blogposts on &#39;Jupyter as an External Tool for Power BI Desktop&#39;. It really opened up lot of options that I didn&#39;t know existed, thanks David! I highly encourage you to read all the four posts to learn more about using Python with Power BI. . Secondly, none of this would be possible without the python-ssas module by Josh Dimarsky which enables TOM connection to Analysis Services. . To get started, you will need three things: . install the pythonnet library (pip install pythonnet) | Make sure you have Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Tabular.dll and Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient.dll dlls. If you use Excel, Power BI, you will most likley already have them. As Josh mentions in his documentation, they are usually installed in C: Windows Microsoft.NET assembly GAC_MSIL | copy the ssas_api.py file from here and save it in your Python libraries folder or Jupyter working directory. | . import pandas as pd import ssas_api as ssas import seaborn as sns . Connect to Premium Workspace . First we want to connect to our Power BI service account &amp; the Premium workspace. You will need to find the workspace connection string URL. It will be in this format powerbi://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/[tenant name]/[workspace name]. You can obtain it from your workspace settings (see below) . First go to your Premium Workspace and click on Settings. Notice that I have three datasets in this workspace, viz Dataset1, dataset2 and dataset2_2. . . Next, copy the server address from Workspace Connection: . . Create variables for your tenant username and password . server = &#39;workspace_connection_from_above&#39; username = &#39;name@email.com&#39; password = &#39;password&#39; . Setup connection string by specifying the server name, username &amp; password. Note that I have left the database name (db_name) blank here because I am assuming that we don&#39;t know the names of the datasets that are available in this workspace. We will explore the workspace and get a list of all the datasets. If you already know the dataset name, you can enter it between the single quotations. . conn1 = ssas.set_conn_string( server=server, db_name=&#39;&#39;, username=username, password=password ) . Import libraries for Tabular Object Model (TOM) and setup the TOM server. As long as your username and password are valid, you will connect to your workspace using TOM. If it fails, it means either your credentials are incorrect or you do not have access to the workspace. You will not be prompted for interactive authentication. . global System, DataTable, AMO, ADOMD import System from System.Data import DataTable import Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Tabular as TOM import Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient as ADOMD try: TOMServer = TOM.Server() TOMServer.Connect(conn1) print(&quot;Connection to Workspace Successful !&quot;) except: print(&quot;Connection to Workspace Failed&quot;) . Connection to Workspace Successful ! . Access Datasets . Let&#39;s now get a list of all the avaible datasets in this workspace and their metadata such as compatibility level, database id, size in megabytes, creation date and last update date. . datasets = pd.DataFrame(columns=[&#39;Dataset_Name&#39;, &#39;Compatibility&#39;, &#39;ID&#39;, &#39;Size_MB&#39;,&#39;Created_Date&#39;,&#39;Last_Update&#39; ]) for item in TOMServer.Databases: datasets = datasets.append({&#39;Dataset_Name&#39; :item.Name, &#39;Compatibility&#39;:item.CompatibilityLevel, &#39;Created_Date&#39; :item.CreatedTimestamp, &#39;ID&#39; :item.ID, &#39;Last_Update&#39; :item.LastUpdate, &#39;Size_MB&#39; :(item.EstimatedSize*1e-06) }, ignore_index=True) datasets . Dataset_Name Compatibility ID Size_MB Created_Date Last_Update . 0 Dataset1 | 1465 | a28e52a8-d6b3-4b5c-8e61-e107fbd52748 | 1.916094 | 8/21/2018 3:34:53 PM | 12/11/2020 11:24:21 AM | . 1 dataset2_2 | 1520 | a93244fe-860d-45c2-9d36-b44fb284c54d | 0.454222 | 12/11/2020 10:01:57 AM | 12/11/2020 11:20:50 AM | . I have three datasets in this workspace but I only see 2! dataset2 and dataset2_2 are identical except dataset2 was created by uploading the csv file to the worspace while the other two datasets were published to the workspace from Power BI Desktop. Also note that their compatibility levels are different. Dataset1 was published with the old version of Power BI Desktop with &#39;Enhanced Metadata&#39; option turned off that&#39;s why its compatibility level is not 1520. Since September 2020 release, Power BI Desktop automatically converts the datasets to Enhanced Metadata. . Now let&#39;s choose the dataset we want to connect to. In this case I want to access dataset2_2. I will copy the database id from the ID column from the above table. Then we will find the names of all the tables that are available in that dataset. . ds = TOMServer.Databases[&#39;a93244fe-860d-45c2-9d36-b44fb284c54d&#39;] for table in ds.Model.Tables: print(table.Name) . dataset2 . In the dataset2_2 dataset, the only available table is dataset2. Let&#39;s connect to this table. We will create a new connection string by specifying the db_name this time. . conn2 = (ssas.set_conn_string( server=server, db_name=&#39;dataset2_2&#39;, username = &#39;name@email.com&#39;, password = &#39;password&#39; )) . You can write any valid DAX query against this table and get the results back as a Pandas dataframe. . dax_string = &#39;&#39;&#39; //Write your DAX Query here EVALUATE dataset2 &#39;&#39;&#39; df_dataset2 = (ssas .get_DAX( connection_string=conn, dax_string=dax_string) ) df_dataset2.head() . dataset2[vendorID] dataset2[passengerCount] dataset2[tripDistance] dataset2[hour_of_day] dataset2[day_of_week] dataset2[day_of_month] dataset2[month_num] dataset2[normalizeHolidayName] dataset2[isPaidTimeOff] dataset2[snowDepth] dataset2[precipTime] dataset2[precipDepth] dataset2[temperature] dataset2[totalAmount] . 0 2 | 1 | 2.62 | 2 | 6 | 19 | 6 | None | False | 0.0 | 1 | 0 | 23.116071 | 11.80 | . 1 2 | 1 | 0.42 | 17 | 6 | 19 | 6 | None | False | 0.0 | 1 | 0 | 23.116071 | 4.30 | . 2 2 | 1 | 1.78 | 18 | 6 | 19 | 6 | None | False | 0.0 | 1 | 0 | 23.116071 | 12.96 | . 3 2 | 1 | 1.26 | 16 | 6 | 19 | 6 | None | False | 0.0 | 1 | 0 | 23.116071 | 9.36 | . 4 2 | 1 | 2.37 | 22 | 6 | 19 | 6 | None | False | 0.0 | 1 | 0 | 23.116071 | 10.80 | . sns.boxplot(df_dataset2[&#39;dataset2[totalAmount]&#39;]) . &lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel=&#39;dataset2[totalAmount]&#39;&gt; . Access Measures . We can also get a list of all the measures and their DAX expressions. As seen below, in this table we have only one measure called totalAmount average per vendorID with its DAX. . table = ds.Model.Tables.Find(&#39;dataset2&#39;) for measure in table.Measures: print(measure.Name, &quot;: n&quot;, measure.Expression) . totalAmount average per vendorID : AVERAGEX( KEEPFILTERS(VALUES(&#39;dataset2&#39;[vendorID])), CALCULATE(SUM(&#39;dataset2&#39;[totalAmount])) ) . Based on this Microsoft documentation, I was under the impression that only the datasets with Compatibility level 1500 or higher could be accessed via XMLA. That&#39;s not the case. Dataset1 has a compatibility of 1465 and can still be accessed via XMLA endpoint as seen below. . conn3 = (ssas.set_conn_string( server=server, db_name=&#39;Dataset1&#39;, username = &#39;name@email.com&#39;, password = &#39;password&#39; )) dax_string2 = &#39;&#39;&#39; //Write your DAX Query here EVALUATE KeyInfluencers_Predictors &#39;&#39;&#39; df_dataset1 = (ssas .get_DAX( connection_string=conn3, dax_string=dax_string2) ) df_dataset1.head() .

Datasets in Power BI service can currently be accessed via number of different tools (SSDT, SSMS, PowerShell, Tabular Editor, DAX Studio, ALM Toolkit) which are all database modeling tools. But Data Scientists now can easily access the datasets for exploring the data and building machine learning models in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode using Python. . This method can also be used to export multiple refreshed dataset(s) on a schedule and on demand. . There are still few things I am not sure about and need to explore more. . Can I use service principal, key etc so I don&#39;t have to write username/password in my code | How to write back, create dataset using Python and push it to the workspace | Can I create/modify measures? | What are the limitations ? | .

Below are the links Module 1, Day 1 | Module 2, Day 2 | Module 3, Day 3 | Module 4, Day 4 | . | Pluralsight: Pluralsight, in partnership with Microsoft, offers free instroctor led DP-100 courses. I watched most of them, I found Ginger&#39;s course above more thorough. | Cloudacademy also offers DP-100 course (not free). I created a free 7 day trial account to check out the content and it&#39;s very bad. It&#39;s basically just commentary on the examples from the labs above. Don&#39;t waste your time. If you already have a cloud academy membership, you can explore but don&#39;t pay for it. | Udacity: Udacity has a Azure ML Engineer program in collaboration with Microsoft. I won the scholarship for that course. It covers all the DP-100 topics and plus some more. If you are enrolled in this course, you should be able to pass DP-100 comfortably. I wouldn&#39;t take the course just to prepare for the exam. The content in the course is good but very similar to Ginger&#39;s videos above. | If you want to learn more advanced Azure ML sdk, this is a great repo with all the tutorials and examples. This is above and beyond what&#39;s required for DP-100 and I recommend completing above labs first before using this. | Tips . Don&#39;t skip the labs. You will be asked questions on Azure ML SDK and you need to know it very well | You will be asked questions on regression, classification modeling and metrics so you need to know machine learning. | Almost all the courses/resources above (except some courses on Pluralsight) assume that you know how to create regression, classification models.

            "content": "Video . You can read the summary below or watch the video . . Linear Regression . Linear regression is the simplest and the most basic form of regression. Many textbooks and videos cover it in detail. To predict an outcome y using features x1,x2,x3..., we take a weighted sum of all the features (plus an intercept term). The weight assigned to each feature is obtained by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE). The larger the weight, the higher it contributes to predicting y. The main advantages of using linear regression are that it is fairly easy to interprete, model and doesn&#39;t require lot of data. The drawbacks are that it requires features to be uncorrelated, features need to be numerical, model often underfits the data and it cannot be used for complex non-linear relationships. If the feautures are correlated they can reduce the accuracy of the predictions and results become less interpretable. . . The weights calculated using the min(SSE) criterion have high bias and low variance. We can fix this by adding more non-linear additive terms, thereby increasing the bias but lowering the variance. As the model becomes relatively more complex, the weights obtained for these features also increase and can lead to larger variance. To tackle this problem, a penalty term is added to SSE that penalizes the features that have large weights. If the penalty is 0, resulting model is just OLS but as the penalty increases, the weights have to shrink to satisfy min(SSE) criterion. As the weights become very large, they almost shrink to zero. If we can identify the right penalty, we can achieve lower variance sacrificing bias. Such model will generalize better and will be less susciptible to effects from multicollinear features. . The penalty can be assigned to the absolute sum of the weights (L1 norm) or sum of squared weights (L2 norm). Linear regression using L1 norm is called Lasso Regression and regression with L2 norm is called Ridge Regression. . Azure ML Studio offers Ridge regression with default penalty of 0.001. As mentioned above, if the penalty is small, it becomes OLS Linear Regression. This penalty can be adjusted to implement Ridge Regression. Typically the penalty is calculated using k-fold cross-validation for a range of penalty values either by random search or grid search. Unfortunately Azure ML Studio does not offer parameter sweep / grid search for tuning the L2 penalty in the Studio, so we will have to find the optimal penalty in the notebook and use it in the designer. Note that the penalty depends on the data, so if the data change significantly, the value will have to be re-calculated. As the penalty increases, bias increases but variance reduces (because model complexity reduces due to penalty on weights) and after an optimal value of the penalty, variance increases again. . .

As the results show, with Linear Regression, RMSE is 300 and 388 on train &amp; test, resp. With Ridge Regression, I tuned the parameter to alpha=402 and obtained RMSE of 342/327. Thus using Ridge regression, the RMSE on training set increased (higher bias) but the RMSE on test set decreased (lower variance). In comparison, Lasso Regression was slightly worse than Ridge regression. Decision Tree and Random Forest were significantly better without tuning any parameters ! . .

The chart and table above show weight on each feature used to train the model. In all cases, the weights have decreased with Ridge Regression compared to Linear Regression. That&#39;s the effect of using a high penalty. In comparison, Lasso regresion shrinks the weights to exactly zero for some of the features. Lasso has an advantage of feature selection. Out of the 21 features used, only 8 features have non-zero weights and are important for predicting the outcome! . Azure ML Studio . In Azure ML designer the L2 penalty did not produce same results despite using the same data and parameters. I suspected that this is because Azure ML Studio uses the FastLinearRegressor() instead of Ridge() from scikit-learn. So I tuned the parameters using FastLinearRegressor() from nimbusml. The optimal L2 was 0.04 to 0.06. This showed improvement over the OLS Regression in AzureML Studio. RMSE over test set dropped from 355 to 345. Not a significant drop but if linear regresison is needed, Ridge will generalize better than Linear Regression. . . OLS vs Ridge Results in Studio . Top are training and bottom are test scores . Linear . L2: 0.001 . Training RMSE: 299 . Test RMSE: 355 . . Ridge . L2: 0.05 . Training RMSE: 302 . Test RMSE: 345 . . My take-aways are : . Azure ML Studio offers Ridge Regression which can provide better results over Linear Regression when features have multi-collinearity | Azure ML Studio does not offer tuning or grid-searching the L2 penalty. This has to be done either by running multiple experiments in the Studio or in external notebook. | FastLinearRegressor() does not offer Lasso Regression directly but by adjusting the l1_threshold parameter we can run Lasso or ElasticNet Regression. This will achieve a compromise between Lasso and Ridge. Lasso or ElasticNet are not available in the Studio. | By default FastLinearRegressor() normalizes the data, it&#39;s not clear from the documentation if thats the default behaviour in Studio when L2 penalty is used. | The hyperparameters tuned in sklearn do not directly work in Studio. Be sure tune them in Studio. | .",

            "title": "Missing Value Analysis & Imputation in Azure ML Designer",
            "content": "Missing Values . Missing values in a dataset is one of the most common problems and cleaning/preprocessing the data can affect the data analysis, ML model predictions. Missing values can come in many forms, e.g. . Data are completely missing | Values appear as N/A, Null, -, &quot; . &quot; etc. Data Analyst/Engineer/Scientist will have to code these values as missing | In some cases 0 may indicate a valid value while 0 may also indicate missing value. In such cases, domain knowledge helps to identify missing values. | | . Missing Data Mechanism . Missing Completely At Random, MCAR: . There is no explanation as to why the data are missing and probability of missing is uniformly distributed. Missingness cannot be attributed to any other variables that are in the data or not included in the data. e.g. you have installed 100 sensors to measure temperature of a machine and few of the sensors ran out of battery or are just bad or not properly installed etc recorded no data for a brief amount of time. There is no systematic pattern to it and is just by luck. In this case, missingness is due to MCAR. Typically missingness by MCAR is few values. If missing data are large, then there is high probability that there are some variables causing the missingness. . Missing At Random, MAR: If we can attribute missing to other observed variables in the data, then the data are missing by MAR. For example, out of those 100 sensors, 25 were made by company A and usually the missingness is observed to be after 1000-1200 hours of installation when ambient temperature is between 90-110F. This indicates that the life of sensors by company A perhaps follow some weibull/exponential distribution dependent on duration and ambient temperature. Thus, there is high correlation between missing values and these factors (company, duartion and ambient temperature). This is more common and can be identified by exploratory data analysis. In general, it&#39;s good practice to assume the data are missing by MAR and try to identify the correlating factors. . Missing Not At Random, MNAR: If the data are missing neither by chance or by influence from observed data, then it is MNAR. This is the hardest mechanism to identify and address. This just means that missingness is caused by factors that are unknown and are external. Imagine some of the thermocouples in the example above are installed close to a vibrating part which vibrates excessively only when the load on the machine increases significantly, which causes the thermocouple wires to disconnect momentarily. Since there are multiple factors here that are not recorded, root cause is harder to pinpoint and can only be identified by experimentation and sensitivity (what-if analysis). While this may seem similar to MCAR, the difference is that MNRA has some probability of occurence (some pattern) while MCAR does not. . The mechanism of missingness informs which imputation strategy to use. . Missing Value Quantification &amp; Visualization . import statsmodels.api as sm import numpy as np air = sm.datasets.get_rdataset(&quot;airquality&quot;).data air.replace(&#39;NaN&#39;, np.nan, inplace=True) print(&quot;Missing_Values_count: &quot;, air.isna().sum()) print(&quot;Missing_Values_%: &quot;, (air.isna().mean() * 100).round(1)) . Missing_Values_count: Ozone 37 Solar.R 7 Wind 0 Temp 0 Month 0 Day 0 dtype: int64 Missing_Values_%: Ozone 24.2 Solar.R 4.6 Wind 0.0 Temp 0.0 Month 0.0 Day 0.0 dtype: float64 . missingno is a great library to visualize patterns in missing data . import missingno as miss miss.matrix(air); . Barplot . miss.bar(air); . Common Imputation Strategies . Listwise deletion : Delete all rows that have missing values. This is the easiest and often used strategy. This will will work only when the missingness is due to MCAR because the number of values are few (&lt;1%) and are unlikely to affect the accuracy as it produces unbiased estimates under MCAR assumption. The drawbacks are : . Size of observed data is reduced. This will affect non-linear models (e.g. tree based models) which benefit from more observations. Linear models (linear regression, logistic regression, SVM etc.) benefit from more features so may not be as much affacted. | If the data are not MCAR, this will bias the population estimates. | . In general if the missing data are few and can be attributed to MCAR, deletion is the most straightforward approach. . | Single Value Imputation: Replace the missing data with population estimates such as mean, median, mode, percentile etc. This is by far the most used method of imputation. If the feature is symmatrically distributes, either mean or median will work but if it is skewed, median should be used to replace values. Drawbacks are: . This is a problem if the data re MAR or MNAR as using a single value will definitely bias the estimates. Imagine in the example above, we replace the missing temperature with average temperature of 75F without giving regard to the ambient temperature. A non-linear model will capture this noise as a signal and will predict incorrect values. | It reduces the variability in the feature, and thus predictive power of that feature | ALWAYS split the data first, calculate the mean/median etc for the training set and use the SAME mean/median for the test/evaluation set. Apply scaling and other transformations after imputing. | . | Forward/Backward Fill/Interpolation: This is typically used in time series analysis when there is high autocorrelation in the data, i.e values are correlated to its past/future. We would either carry forward the last value to fill the missing value or calculate moving average (centrak or expanding window) and then fill the value. The main drawback is that it doesnt work with highly non-linear features or when the data have no autocorrelation. Interpolation will work by interpolating over the data. We can choose linear, quadratic, cubic etc. This will require some domain knowledge to choose the right interpolation method. | Indicator Variable: This is typically used for missing categorical data. This can be thought of as feature engineering. Replace the missing category with a category (e.g. &quot;missing&quot; or &quot;N/A&quot; etc.) and add another dummy column that indicates the category was missing. The ML algorithm will treat it as a feature and if you have large enough dataset, will learn the missingness pattern. This will work best for non-linear algorithms. | MICE ( Multiple Imputation By Chained Equation): MICE does multivariate regression analysis that is multiple times to converge at values. This is a very useful technique, especially when the data are missing by MAR. It is a good practice to compare summary statistics of the missing variable before and after applying MICE. MICE is a very robust imputation method. | KNN Imputation: K-nearest Neighbor can be used to find samples in the training set that are closest to the missing values and average the nearby points to predict the missing value. The purpose of imputation is not only to find possible true value but also to keep the original data structure. It&#39;s been shown that kNN imputation achieves both very efficiently and is a very effective technique Ref. | While sklearn/statsmodels/pandas offers all of the above imputation techniques, Azure ML does not. Azure ML Studio Classic had MICE and Probabilistic PCA but they are absent from the Designer. I discuss some of the above techniques in the video below. . To demonstrate some of the options avialable, I will use the following example table I created. This dataset . Index Missing_1 Missing_2 Missing_6 Misisng_8 Missing_Cat1 Missing_Ca2 Missing_2-2 . 0 1 | 320.0 | 249.0 | NaN | 224.0 | Gold | Gold | 26 | . 1 2 | 613.0 | 251.0 | NaN | NaN | Blue | Blue | 74 | . 2 3 | 260.0 | 294.0 | 590.0 | NaN | Silver | Silver | 174 | . 3 4 | 419.0 | NaN | NaN | NaN | Red | Red | 0 | . 4 5 | 485.0 | 415.0 | 386.0 | NaN | Blue | Blue | 488 | . 5 6 | NaN | 655.0 | NaN | NaN | Silver | NaN | 435 | . 6 7 | 61.0 | 37.0 | NaN | NaN | Red | Red | 588 | . 7 8 | 41.0 | NaN | NaN | NaN | Yellow | Yellow | - | . 8 9 | 607.0 | 254.0 | 369.0 | NaN | Blue | Blue | 363 | . 9 10 | 423.0 | 407.0 | 80.0 | 495.0 | Blue | Blue | 512 | . Update: I forgot to show in the video how single value imputation reduces variability. Consider the column Missing_2. With missing values, the standard deviation of the column is 178. But if we replace the 2 missing values with the mean of the column, 320, the standard deviation is 157. The more values we replace, the lower the variability. If the variance reduces significantly, it will not be an effective predictor of the outcome. Note that the mean remains the same after imputation. . print(&quot;Mean :,&quot;,data[&quot;Missing_2&quot;].mean()) print(&quot;Std :&quot;, data[&quot;Missing_2&quot;].std()) data[&quot;Missing_2_imp&quot;] = data[&quot;Missing_2&quot;].replace(np.nan,data[&quot;Missing_2&quot;].mean()) .

            "content": "Introduction . A Reddit user posted a question on r/PowerBI forum few days ago about &quot;... Table.Profile that respects slicers and deals with strings...&quot; I answered the question by noting that it would be a easier to do it with DAX using SWITCH(). But coincidentally, I had a similar requirement for a project where the user wanted to get summary statistics for each numerical column and filterable by a slicer. The summary statistics in my case also included some custom functions. I could have created calculated columns, but Power Query offers a faster &amp; memory-efficient solution. The reddit user had question about strings but I am going to focus on numerical columns only for simplicity. This is a quick way to get summary statistics for exploratory data analysis or checking data quality. . Table.Profile() . As this user mentioned in the question, the easiest and fastest way to get descriptive statistics is to wrap the table with Table.Profile(). Read the documentation here. By default, Table.Profile() returns min, max, average, standard deviation, count, null count, distinct count. But you can add more aggregates or custom functions by specifying the second parameter additionalAggregates as nullable list. Lars Schreiber has an excellent blog post on using that second parameter. . In the example below, I added median and a custom function to count number of outliers in each column. This second parameter can be specified as ColumnName . Custom Function to Count Outliers . #hide_output (mylist as list, optional limit as number) =&gt; let // Function to count number of outlier value based on how far it is from the average. // By default values that are 2 standard deviations away form the mean are counted as outliers // Sandeep Pawar // PawarBI.com // Date: 7/2/2020 mean = List.Average(mylist), sd = List.StandardDeviation(mylist), limit = 2, outliers = List.Select( mylist, each _ &gt; (mean + limit*sd)), outcount = List.Count(outliers) in outcount . To use this custom function fxoutlier(list,limit) in Table.Profile(), I can write: . #hide_output Table.Profile(TableName, {{&quot;Outliers&quot;, each Type.Is(_, nullable number), each fxoutlier(_,null)}}) .

            "title": "Random Number Generation in Power BI",
            "content": "Random Number Generation . A quick post on creating random numbers in Power BI. While it&#39;s very easy to use, there are couple of things to keep in mind to get correct results. Typically the random numbers aren&#39;t needed in Power BI reports but I use them very often for simulations, statsitical functions and synthetic data generation. . What are random numbers? . As series of values is said to contain random numbers if all the values have equal probability of occurence and there is no correlation, i.e. the numbers are uniformly distributed. . How to generate random numbers? . In DAX, you can use RAND() function to generate random numbers. Similarly, to generate random numbers between two numbers, use RANDBETWEEN(). . In Power Query, List.Random() creates a list of random numbers, while Number.Random() creates a single random number. You can add an index column before using the Number.Random() to get different random numbers on each row. You can delete the index column after the Number.Random() step. There isn&#39;t a List.RandomBetween() but Number.RandomBetween() can be used along with index column to generate numbers between two specified values. . Tip 1: DAX and M RandomBetween behave differently . If you generate random numbers between (1,100) using DAX RANDOMBETWEEN(1,100), it will generate integer/whole numbers between (1,100) and will include numbers 1 and 100. In constrast to that, in Power Query Number.RandomBetween(1,100) will generate decimal numbers between 1 and 100 and will exclude 100. Thus, if you are using M and want to include 100, use Number.RandomBetween(1,101). . To generate integer random values using M, first add an index column and then create a custom column using Int16.From(Number.RandomBetween(1,100)). This includes numbers 1 and 100. . Tip 2: Multiple Random numbers in Power Query . To create multiple columns containing random numbers, add an index column each time before using the Number.Random(). You can delete the columns later. . You can alse wrap the step before the Number.Random() step with Table.Buffer() to generate different number on each row. For example, if you added a custom column in the step previous to adding random number column, your step would look like Table.Buffer(Table.AddColumn(...)). In this case you will not need to add an index column. If you need to add multiple random number columns, you can buffer the previous step each time. But be careful of the performance and transformation implications of Table.Buffer(). Read more abou it here. Thanks to Gil Raviv for this tip.. . Tip 3: You can use RAND() to create decimal random numbers between two numbers . As RANDBETWEEN() creates integers, you can use RAND()*N to create decimal numbers between (0,N). In this case, the numbers will not include 0 and N. . Similarly, to generate decimal random numbers between (N1,N2) use N1 + RAND() *(N2-N1). N1 &amp; N2 are not included. . You can divide RANDBETWEEN() by 10^i, to create numbers with &#39;i&#39; decimal digits . Tip 4: IMPORTANT Be careful with using ROUND() with RAND() . As mentioned above, all random numbers should have equal probability of occurence otherwise it violates the uniform distribution assumption. If you use ROUND() with RAND() ( e.g.ROUND(RAND()*50,0)) to generate integers between 0 and 50, the end numbers will have half the probability of occurence compared to rest of the numbers. This is because numbers greater than or equal to 0.5 will be rounded to the next integer. e.g. 49.25 will be rounded down to 49 whereas 49.68 will be rounded up to 50. Thus, the end values have half the probability of occurence. The correct way is to use INT() i.e INT(RAND()*50). While the error resulting from this will be minimal, it&#39;s better to use the correct formula when creating synthetic data to avoid bias. . Tip 5: DAX &amp; M do not allow random seed . In Python and R, you can specify the seed number to generate reproducible random numbers. Both in DAX &amp; M do not allow seed, so with each refresh new random numbers are generated. In many cases, this is not desirable. A work around for that is to generate random numbers in Power Query using M, indexing those and disabling the refresh for that query. . Create an index column and random number column using . Table.FromColumns( { {1..n_samples}, List.Random(n_samples)}, {&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;NRandom&quot;} ) . where n_samples &gt;&gt;&gt; number of random values you need. For example, if you are going to need 3 sets of random numbers 1000 each, use n_samples &gt;&gt; 3000 ,say 5000. . | Uncheck &quot;Include in report refresh&quot; for that query | Now you can use this list by using FILETR() in DAX by passing Table[Index] &lt; 1001 and so forth | . Tip 6: Randomly subsample the data by using SAMPLE() in DAX . I use this often to check robsutness/sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to the features used. For example, some columns may show correlaton or importance when used entirely but when sub-sampled may or may not. . To sample a column, use SAMPLE(sample_size, &#39;Table&#39;, &#39;Table&#39;[Column]) . Ruth provides a good overview of the SAMPLE() function below: . Tip 7: Randomly generate letters or sequence of letters . You can use UNICHAR() and RANDBETWEEN() to generate random letters . To generate upper case latters: UNICHAR(RANDBETWEEN(65,90) . To generate lower case latters: UNICHAR(RANDBETWEEN(97,122) . To generate upper &amp; lower case latters: UNICHAR(RANDBETWEEN(97,122) &amp; UNICHAR(RANDBETWEEN(65,90) . In addition you can nest them with RANDBETWEEN() to generate a random words, passwords, symbols etc. For a list of unicode chart, see this . Similarly, to generate characters using M, first create an index column and then use: . Character.FromNumber(Int16.From(Number.RandomBetween(65,90))) for upper case letters. Thanks to Alex Powers for the tip. . Tip 8: Changing column type to decimal . When you create the custom column with random numbers using Number.Random() in Power Query, it will be mixed type (123/ABC). If you convert it to Decimal, randomness is lost and all the numbers in the column will be the same. Solution to that is just add another index column ! You can always delete it later. .",

            "content": "Overview . Using Python and R in Power BI, when used correctly, can allow quick experimentation, data/calculation validation, statistical analysis/inferencing of the data. However, before you use Python/R in Power BI keep the performance and data privacy issues in mind. I personally use Python in my report development, model development process but use it as a tool for experimentation rather than replacement to native Power BI tools. Below are my recommendations / tips: . Always read the documentation Python and R for known limitations, official guidelines | . Uncheck “Enhanced meta-data” if you are using Python. Power BI released it as a preview feature in March 2020. Unfortunately, I learned it the hard way. If you use Python in Power Query with this option selected and save the file, it will currupt your file and you cannot recover it back (well, not entirely). Enhanced metadata allows read/write XMLA (Premium feature). This is a serious bug that MS needs to fix. If you need to use this option, use R. | . . Keep the data privacy implications in mind. Data Privacy must be set to &quot;Public&quot; . While that does not mean the report/dashboard/data are made public, do not use Python /R if you are working with sensitive data. When the data privacy is set to &quot;Public&quot;, Microsoft stores it in less restrictive storage but the data is safe. | . Always create and use virtual environment ,e.g. use virtualenv/pipenv, conda. Conda may not always work if multiple Python copies are installed and is a known issue. More on Python virtual enviroment here. Use the directory of the virtual environment as Python home directory. | . . Only install the packages you need. Power BI needs pandas and matplotlib installed at minimum. I personally only use Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn in my Power BI virtual environment. If you find yourself needing more packages, you should consider using the IDE and deploying Python/R outside of Power BI. | . Only import the packages you need, e.g. from scipy.stats import lognorm instead of from scipy import * to the reduce execution time | . By default, Power BI loads pandas, matplotlib and os, no need to re-import it (import pandas as pd). If you do need to alias the package, create a variable, pd=pandas and then you can use pd.read_csv(..) | . Change date column to text before running Python and change it back to Date format after running the script. If you keep it as Date, all Date values will be returned as &quot;Microsoft.OldDb.Date&quot;. You can also change the column type to Date/Time and parse it back but it&#39;s esier to convert text. | . Duplicate the original query and apply Python /R on duplicated query, instead of the original. | . Apply Python / R as the last step or when the rows have been filtered, unnecessary columns have been removed to reduce the *.csv file Power BI creates. The temporary csv file must be &lt;250 MB, so it&#39;s best to reduce the data to keep the file size down. | . Use only one Python / R script in a query, if you must use Python / R. | . Always run Query Diagnostics to make sure Python/R script isn’t the bottleneck, query execution time is &lt;&lt; 5min. Query will time out if the execution time is &gt;30 minutes. Run the script in your IDE to time the execution. If you are using Python, vectorize the data to improve efficiency, avoid for loops, use apply(), avoid intermediate dataframes. | . Power Query is powerful and preferred, so don&#39;t use Python / R as a replacement. Use it for quick experimentation, data validation, spot/sanity checking, calculation validation, statistical analysis only. I use it often in my workflow for finding patterns, anamolies, outliers, correlation etc. using Power BI + Jupyter (blog to come. ). I have intentionally left out Machine Learning here. I do not think an ML model should be deployed as a Python / R script because of the limitations and it&#39;s a bad deployment practice in general. ML models need to be revised, monitored for performance, data drift etc and Power BI does not allow that. Do not deploy ML models in Power Query | . Use Power Query Parameter in Python /R if you need to reuse a script or need a quick way to change arguments,params. You can pass &amp;Text.From([param]) or &amp;Number.From([param]) in any Python / R script to make it more dynamic. | . Apply correct summarization for visuals (No summarization, sum, average etc.), always add an index/unique key to make sure rows are not removed. | . Create Python/R visuals after you have finalized column/measure names. Renaming column/measure will throw an error . | Use native Power BI visuals for production reports and Python/R visuals for getting more insights and for experimentation. Power/R visuals are very slow to refresh and do not allow cross-filtering, highlighting. . | If you do use Python/R visual in production report, run the Performance Analyzer to check execution &amp; refresh time. If it&#39;s too slow, consider using native visuals or build one in charticulator. I rarely use custom visuals to avoid dependency and data security reasons. . | .

            "content": "Overview . In Part 1 I covered the exploratory data analysis of a time series using Python &amp; R and in Part 2 I created various forecasting models, explained their differences and finally talked about forecast uncertainty. In this post, I hope to provide a definitive guide to forecasting in Power BI. I wanted to write about this because forecasting is critical for any business and the documentation on this is very thin, and it&#39;s easy to (mis)use it. . If you do not have experience in forecasting, I would encourage you to read the above two blogs to learn more about forecasting in general. . I will use the same dataset I used in the earlier blog posts and compare the Power BI forecast with the Python models I created. . How to create a forecast in PowerBI? . It&#39;s very easy! Parker Stevens gives a nice overview of it in the clip below. . . To create a forecast you need: . A continuous date column | A numerical column with the numbers you want to forecast . Drag and drop the dates in &quot;Axis&quot; field | Drag and drop the numbers in the &#39;Values&#39; field | Click on the down arrow in the &#39;Date&#39; field and apply the required hierarchy (month, quarter, week etc.) or remove &#39;Date Hierarchy&#39; if you do not want hierarchy. If removed, it will plot the data for each date rather than the hierarchy. | In the Format options, make sure the X Axis type is &#39;Continuous&#39; | Go to &#39;Analytics&#39; pane, Forecast &gt; +Add &gt; Enter the Forecast Length | | . That&#39;s it ! We have a forecast. You can hover over the line chart to get the forecast predictions along with confidence interval. Very easy. . But how do we know: . if the forecast is accurate | What model(s) was used to create the forecast? | what assumptions were made to make the forecast? | what&#39;s the forecast uncertainty? | how do we display the forecasts? | what are the limitations? | can we improve the forecast? | when is it appropriate or no appropriate to use it? | . Let&#39;s first take a look at the documentation from the Power BI team and see if we can aswer some of these questions. . How does Power BI create the forecast? . I found couple of official blog posts on Power BI&#39;s website that were written in 2014 and 2016. The blog written in 2014 was for Power View which has been deprecated but the post still shows up under Power BI&#39;s blog. Other than that, I couldn&#39;t find anything. Given the lack of information, I will assume these posts still describe the current forecasting procedure in Power BI. I will use Python to follw the same procedure and see if we can understand it better. . Which forecasting model is used? . According to this blog, Power BI uses the ETS(AAA) and ETS(AAN) models to model seasonal and non-seasonal data, respectively. I used and described these models in Part 2. But here is a quick non-mathematical recap: . ETS stands for Error, Trend, Seasonality. It is an exponential smoothing model which gives exponential weightage to the historical data to predict the future values. | The data is first decomposed into level, trend, and seasonality. Error is obtained by subtracting the level, trend and and seasonality from the actual values. | Level is the average value over the observed period | Trend is the change in level over this period | Seasonality is the behaviour of the observed quantity from one season to next. e.g. if you have a monthly data for toy sales, sales would be up around holidays from Nov-Jan and then down in the following months. | It&#39;s called exponential smoothing because exponential weights are applied to successive historical values. | Trend, Seasonality and the Error terms can be combined in additive, multiplicative or mixed fashion. . Additive = (Level+Trend) + Seasonality + Error . | . Multiplicative = (Level * Trend) * Seasonality * Error . In addition, the Trend component can be &quot;Damped&quot;. i.e. we &#39;derate&#39; the growth of the trend | . The ETS models follow ETS(XYZ) nomenclature: . X: Error Term. It can be Additive (A), Multiplicative (M) . | Y: Trend Term. It can Additive (A), Multiplicative (M) or Damped (Ad), or No trend (N) . | Z: Seasonality. Additive (A) or Multiplicative(M), or No seasonality (N) . | . | . As the illustration below shows, if the trend is linear, it&#39;s &quot;additive&quot;. If it shows exponential growth, multiplicative model would fit better. | Similarly, if the quantity being studied varies in a stable way relative to average levels, seasonality can be modeled as &quot;additive&quot;. If the change from one season to next, relative to average, can be expressed in terms of % of average, then &quot;multiplicative&quot; model would be a better fit. Read Part 2 to get better understanding of this. There are 36 possible combinations depending on A,M,Ad,N. Only some of these are practical. . | Out of 15 or so possible practical ETS models, Power BI uses two models ETS(AAN), ETS(AAA). You can read more about ETS here . | In general, ETS often provides the most accurate forecasts, even better than the complex neural network models Ref | . . ETS(AAN) . This is &quot;Additive&quot; error, &quot;Additive&quot; trend and &quot;No&quot; seasonality model used when there is no seasonality in the time series. If you are familiar with Holt-Winter&#39;s exponential models, this is Holt&#39;s linear model. | You would use this model when you see a linear trend in the data and no seasonality pattern. | If you are familiar with ARIMA models, this is equivalent to ARIMA(0,2,2) | This is not single exponential smoothing (SES). SES (i.e ETS(ANN)) is used when the data doesn&#39;t have any trend either. | See an example below. It shows Google&#39;s stock performance over time. It has a positive trend but no seasonality. The forecast with an ETS (AAN) model is just a straight line that extends the trend into the future. . . | . ETS(AAA) . This model should be used when there is linear trend and seasonality. | This is the Holt-Winter&#39;s triple exponential smoothing model | See the example below. This data shows quarterly milk production. It has an obvious positive, linear trend and seasonality. Notice how the production jumps up in certain quarters of the year and then drops in following seasons. the height of the peaks in seasons remains same relative to the trend. &quot;Additive&quot; seasonality shows this behaviour. | . . The blog from 2016 written by MS employee mentions that &quot;.. Power BI uses assembly forecaster..Power BI picks the algorithm..forecaster includes exponential smoothing ..&quot;. Not entirely sure if that means if in addition to above ETS models, Power BI uses any other models. . Another possibility is that I know Microsoft uses nimbusml python/mx.net module in its various products including Power BI for machine learning. NimbusML has ssaForecaster() class which uses Single Spectrum Analysis for forecasting. It&#39;s a powerful forecating method but hasn&#39;t been used widely in the industry because of some limitations. . The 2014 blog also mentions that Power View (now in Power BI) does not use ARTXP or ARIMA methods. ARXTP is Autoregressive tree model with cross-prediction. I have no clue what that is. I have discussed ARIMA in part 2. . How does Power BI create the forecast? . Fortunately the 2014 blog sheds some light on how Power BI creates the forecast. To get the better understanding of the methodology, I am going to try to recreate it in Python. . Data: . I am using the same dataset I used in the previous blogs. This data shows quarterly sales of a French retailer. I have divided the numbers by 1,000 to make them easier to read. We have data for 24 quarters and the goal is to forecast sales for the next 4 quarters and total sales for FY2018. I am going to load the dataset in python. . As the plot below shows we have a clear seasonal data with positive trend.

Let&#39;s create the forecast for this data in Power BI first. . Power BI Forecast . . Observations: . Power BI was able to capture the trend and seasonality very well. | I left the &quot;Seasonality&quot; field blank and Power BI still detected quarterly seasonality. | Power BI shows the 95% &quot;Confidence Interval&quot; as gray band by default | You can inspect the forecast by selcting &quot;Show as table&quot; and can also &quot;Export data&quot; | Power BI does not show the forecast values. You have to hover over the line chart to know the values. | Forecast values are not accessible for further calculations or use in measures/calculated columns. | Now let&#39;s see how Power BI creates the forecast as described in the blog. . Creating Validation Window . First a validation window is created. Here is what the blog says: . ...The classical Holt-Winters method finds the optimal smoothing parameters by minimizing the mean sum of squares of errors for predictions in the training window, looking only at predictions that are one-step ahead. However, the errors you get from looking just one step ahead might not be representative of the errors you get when you want a longer horizon forecast. Therefore, to improve long-range forecasting error, we introduced a validation window, which contains the last few points of the training window. Within this validation window, we do not adjust the state at each and every step, but instead, compute the sum of squares of prediction errors for the window as a whole. This has the effect of dampening variation and preserving trend across the validation window... . What this means: In classical forecasting, the parameters of the model are optimized by using all the given data, making forecasts one step at a time and then minimizing the mean sum of square errors (SSE). SSE is calculated by subtracting the 1-step forecasts from the actual values and then squaring them. Errors could be positive or negative so if we add them as is, they may add upto 0. Squaring solves that problem. The issue with this approach is we typically want a long term forecast and using the above approach we cannot assess the accuracy of the forecast for long horizon. To overcome this, in a machine learning model, the data is split into training and test (i.e validation) and model parameters are obtained by using only the training set. The test set is used to assess the accuracy of the model fit. This also helps prevent overfitting (good fit on the training set and poor on the test). . I will split the data into train and test. I will use the first 18 values for training (blue line) and the last 6 for validation (orange line). . Preprocessing the data . It is important that the preprocessing is done after the train/test split and the same preprocessing parameters/steps are applied on both the sets to prevent data leakage. . 1. Missing values: If Power BI detects that any missing values, it will automatically fill in the values using linear interpolation, i.e taking mean of the values before and after the missing value. Power BI performs the imputation as long as the missing values are fewer than 40% of the total observations. . This is a reasonable approach but could potentially be a problem if: . the missing values cannot be imputed with interpolation | missing values/nulls are actually 0&#39;s indicating no sales/production etc. (intermittent time series) | . You should check the data for missingness before doing the forecasting. Also if the data (trend) is not linear, interpolation will result in erroneous data. . To test, I intentionally deleted some of the observations and Power BI still performed the forecasting but did not show the interpolated values in the table. It would be good to know what values were used. If the missing values are close to the end, it will definitely affect the forecast as exponential smoothing gives higher weightage to the recent data. . 2. Detecting Seasonality: Seasonality is the number of seasons in one full time period. If you have a quarterly data, it has 4 seasonal periods in a year. Similarly, monthly has 12, yearly 1 and weekly has 52 seasonal periods. In Python or R, you have to specify the number of seasonal periods. But in Power BI, seasonality is detected automatically for you. As we saw above, I did not have to enter the Seasonality. Below are the steps and description of each step in identifying the seasonality. . De-trending: Trend is the positive or negative change in the level of the series over the observed period. When trend is present, the series is called &quot;non-stationary&quot;. Some forecasting methods such as ARIMA require the time series to be stationary before the method can be applied. ETS method can be used on stationary and non-stationary data. While Power BI does not apply ARIMA model, series is de-trended so we only have seasonality (and error) left in the series. Presence of trend can affect the periodogram (we will see that below). Series can be de-trended by differencing the previous observation. e.g. in our case, the first 3 observations are [362, 385, 432..]. We de-trend the series by subtracting 362 from 385, 385 from 431 and so on. There is no values before 362 so it becomes null. We lose one observation after differencing. New series will be [null, 23, 47,..] | Here are the data before and after differencing. After differencing there is no trend in the data and it only shows the seasonality. . Z-Normalization: Irrespective of the original and de-trended data distribution, data is z-normalized (i.e. standardized) to make the mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This will make the data normally distributed. Note that normality of data is not an essential condition for forecasting neither does it guarantee improvement in mean forecast. Standardization is necessary in many machine learning methods (especially in regression, neurel net based methods, clustering etc.) to make the features scale independent but is not required in forecasting. Normalized data may lead to narrower prediction interval due to stabilized variance. Another benefit of standardization is that forecasting errors are also scaled. Irrespective of the scale of the original data (100 vs 100,000), after normalization Power BI can compare the error metric with an internal benchmark and further refine the model. I don&#39;t know if Power BI does that but it&#39;s a possibility. | We will test the de-trended data and z-normalized data for normality, calculate mean &amp; standard deviation . De-trended data: . - Jarque Bera p-value: 0.22 , Data is Normal - Mean: Sales 20.29 dtype: float64 , - Std Deviation: Sales 77.01 dtype: float64 . Observations . De-trended data actually shows bi-modal normal distribution. Jarque Bera test confirms normality. | The trend is almost flat, except in the first few observations. This actually means we need higher order differencing to remove trend but for the purposes of our analysis, this is good. | De-trended data has a mean of 20.2 and standard deviation of 77. | . Transformed Data . Transform the data with z-normalization to make mean 0, std 1 and remove trend component . - Jarque Bera p-value: 0.2 , Data is Normal - Mean: Sales_X 0.0 dtype: float64 , - Std Deviation: Sales_X 1.0 dtype: float64 . Observations . Transformed data still show the 2 peak bi-modal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 | . Identify candidate periods from the power spectrum: . So far we have observed the data in time domain but we can also see it in frequency domain to identify prominent frequencies. It&#39;s based on the assumption that it is made up of sine and cosine waves of different frequencies. This helps us detect periodic component of known/unknown frequencies. It can show additional details of the time series that can be easily missed. We do it with a Periodogram . | Rank candidate periods: . Pearson and Spearman auto-correlations are computed for the transformed data. Significant lags in auto-correlation are matched with those found in the frequency analysis. If multiple peaks are found, the lags are arranged and peak with the highest correlation value is used for seasonality. . Auto-correlation is the correlation of the time series with its past values. e.g. to calculate the correlation at 1st lag, time series is shifted by 1 observation and correlation is calculated. Process is repeated for many past versions of itself. If auto-correlation is significant at a particular lag value &#39;k&#39;, it shows that the observations from k periods ago affect the time series significantly. You can read more here. . In the ACF plot any value that is outside the blue band shows significant lag. As we can see below, only the lag at k=4 is significant (~0.75). This matches with the observation from periodogram. . Thus, Power BI can now confirm that this series has seasonality of 4, phew!. I am glad Power BI does all this automatically and fast. . | Notes about seasonality: . Power BI recommends not using very long data as higher order lags have less information and can affect Pearson correlation calculation. Pearson correlation shows linear relationship between two variables. If the data is very log, the linear assumption may not remain valid. | Power BI recommends at least 3-4 seasons worth of data for seasonality detection to work properly. This means for quarterly data &gt;12 values, &gt;36 for monthly, &gt;156 for weekly data | You can also specify the seasonality manually. I highly recommend entering the seasonality manually because I have found that automatic seasonality may not always work as intended. I will show an example below. | . I randomly grabbed a monthly time series from the M3 competition dataset. M3 competition dataset is often used in research as a benchmark for testing various forecasting methods. M3 has 3003 time series of various seasonalities. For this time series, seasonality = 12 and the goal is to forecast next 12 months. I first created the forecast without specifying the seasonality. As you can see in the clip below, the forecast looks weird and definitely not what you would expect. After specifying seasonality =12, the forecast looks much more reasonable. Reducing the length of the series, as recommended by Power BI, did not help either. Automatic seasonality detection is not as robust as we would like. It&#39;s also possible that Power BI&#39;s algorithm is thrown off by the sudden peak in year 1985 which could be an outlier. . Forecasting . To compare the forecasting accuracy, I created a forecast in Power BI based on first 18 values (training set) and forecasted the last 6 values (validation). To be consistent, I entered 4 as seasonality. Table below shows the actual values, forecast, 95% upper and lower CI. . . Sales forecastValue confidenceHighBound confidenceLowBound . Date . 2016-09-30 773 | 813.0 | 864.1 | 761.8 | . 2016-12-31 592 | 636.1 | 689.4 | 582.9 | . 2017-03-31 627 | 725.5 | 797.7 | 653.4 | . 2017-06-30 725 | 785.5 | 873.8 | 697.1 | . 2017-09-30 854 | 900.7 | 1012.3 | 789.1 | . 2017-12-31 661 | 702.9 | 797.0 | 608.9 | . Forecast Accuracy: . There are many forecast model accuracy metrics. The two most common are RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and % MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). You can read more about it in &quot;Evaluation Metric&quot; section in Part 2. In general, if the data has no outliers and 0 values, RMSE is a good metric to use. It can be thought of as the avg error in the mean forecast. While there are more robust and scale independent measures that can be used, we will use RMSE for comparing &amp; evaluating the performance. The smaller the RMSE and MAPE the better. . e.g. for Power BI forecast, RSME = sqrt (avg[ (773-813)^2 + (592-636.1)^2 + (627-725.5)^2 + (854-900.7)^2 + (661-702)^2)]) . . %MAPE RMSE . 0 8.1 | 58.9 | . Observations: . Power BI did an excellent job of capturing the trend and seasonality in the data. | Power BI forecast runs parallel to the actual values by almost the same margin, this may indicate some bias in the forecast | %MAPE is 8% and RMSE is 59. Thus, Power BI forecast, on average, in +/-8% of actual values or in terms of numbers +/- 59. For comaprison purposes, the standard deviation of the data is 111 so this is a really good forecast. | Actual value is outside the CI band in Q1 2017. I will discuss CI little later in the post, first we focus on mean forecasts. | ETS model in Python . Pyhton (and R) has two implimentations of the exponential smoothing methods. Holt-Winter&#39;s (HW) and ETS. ETS has a statistical framework, HW doesnt and HW can be thought of as a subset of ETS. . For HW in Python, you use statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing() class and for state space ETS methods you use statsmodels.tsa.statespace.exponential_smoothing.ExponentialSmoothing() . In R, for HW use hw() and for ETS use ets() from forecast library. . Note: In general, although the ETS(AAA) model is equivalent to Holt-Winter&#8217;s additive linear model, and should give same answers, ETS almost always performs better because of how the parameter initialization and optimization works. You should experiment with HW but ETS more than likely will give more accurate results. . I will create the ETS(AAA) model in Python. . ETS(AAA) . ets1=(sm.tsa.statespace.ExponentialSmoothing( train, #Using training set , first 18 values) trend=True, #Trend is present initialization_method= &#39;concentrated&#39;, seasonal=4, #Quarterly data, seasonality=4 damped_trend=False). #Turn of Damped fit()) py_fc1 = ets1.forecast(6) #forecast next 6 values . %MAPE RMSE . 0 6.4 | 47.0 | . Observations: . ETS(AAA) forecast created in Python tracks the actual values much more closely | RMSE is 47, smaller than Power BI (58.9). Avg MAPE also better by 2.4 pct (6.4% vs. 8%) | One of the observations I noted earlier was that the trend looks more exponential than linear. The &#39;additive&#39; trend component can only capture the linear trends and hence not suitable in this case. The more accurate model would be ETS(MAM). Also, if you closely look at the first plot (top of the page) where I plotted the data with 4Q rolling mean, you can clearly see that the orange line is levelling off towards the end. So we not only have an exponential trend it is slowing at the end. . We can make the exponential trend linear by taking a &#39;log&#39; of the observations and setting damped_trend=True. New model is ETS(A,Ad,A) . ETS(A,Ad,A) . ets_model=sm.tsa.statespace.ExponentialSmoothing(np.log(train), trend=True, initialization_method= &#39;heuristic&#39;, seasonal=4, damped_trend=True).fit() py_fc2 = ets_model.get_forecast(6) results_df=(py_fc2.summary_frame( alpha=0.05).apply( np.exp)[[&quot;mean&quot;,&quot;mean_ci_lower&quot;,&quot;mean_ci_upper&quot;]]) . %MAPE RMSE . 0 5.1 | 40.9 | . Observations: . ETS(A,Ad,A) matches the actual values even better than the earlier ETS(AAA) model | RMSE (40.9) and %MAPE (5%) are better than the ETS(AAA) and Power BI forecast. | Recommendations . The main-take away from the above exercise is that Power BI can create fairly accurate forecasts but has limitations: . The trend and seasonal components have to be linear. If you have exponential and/or damped trend, you may not get accurate results | Automatic detection of seasonality can be spotty. It&#39;s best to manually enter the seasoanlity in the Forecast dialog box in Power BI | Power BI uses two ETS models (AAN) and (AAA). It chooses the method based on its own algorithm. | ETS method has its own limitations. While it can be more robust to outliers compared to ARIMA, location of the outlier (close to the end of the series vs earlier) can throw off the forecast. Power BI detects outliers by monitoring local trend and automatically adjusting forecast accordingly. | ETS cannot be used for high frequency time series such as daily, sub-daily (minute, hourly) data. In fact, weekly data is also pushing the envelope a little bit. The reason for that is in high-frequency data such as weekly you may have multiple seasonalities. For example, if you have weekly sales data, it&#39;s possible that sales may be higher closer to month end (&#39;week of the month&#39;), plus some months may have higher sales than other (&#39;month of year&#39; seasonality). We cannot enter mutiple seasonality values. Thus do not use Power BI forecast for anything other than monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, yearly data, you can use weekly data but with caution. If you have high frequency data you will need to try TBATS, deep-learning, Facebook Prophet models (see part 2). If you do use Power BI forecast for high-frequency data, it will likley use the (AAN) model and give you a straight line with a trend. | Use data with at least 3-4 full seasonal cycles. That translates to &gt;36 for monthly, 12 for quarterly data. | Do not use too much data. While Power BI doesn&#39;t mention what&#39;s too much, I would recommend using only the relevant 5 cycle data if available. | Power BI does not provide model evaluation metric. You can &#39;estimate&#39; the model accuracy by the method described above. Let&#39;s say your forecast horizon is 12 months. Enter 12 in the &#39;Ignore Last&#39; and create a forecast for 12 months. Use the RSME &amp; %MAPE to evaluate the forecast accuracy. While it doesn&#39;t guarantee true forecast accuracy, it at least gives you an estimation. If you don&#39;t have enough data, use the Cross-Validation approach I described in Part 2 | Power BI imputes missing values by linear iterpolation. If your data has non-linear trend, too many missing values (&gt;40%), missing values close to the end of the time series, it&#39;s better to clean up the data yourself than letting Power BI do it automatically. | If your data has many 0&#39;s (no sales, no production etc) which is usually the case for new products or slow moving products (i.e intermittent demand), do not use Power BI forecast. ETS should not be used for intermittent time series. Croston&#39;s method, deep-learning models can be used in that case. | ETS cannot use additional variables (exogenous variables) to improve the forecast. For example, if you sell more products when it&#39;s sunny, warm outside, on weekends, holidays, sport events etc. If the time series has high correlation with such events, you can include them in the forecast model for better accuracy. SARIMAX, deep-learning, gradient boosting models can be used for that. AutoML in Azure ML has built in holiday calendar and can include all these variables in the forecast. | An important and essential part of any statistical/machine learning model is model diagnostics. We want to make sure the model is valid, accurate, doesn&#39;t overfit and has extracted all the information from the available data. It is usually done by residual diagnsotics. Power BI doesn&#39;t provide any model diagnostics or parameter values etc. I am going to skip that part here but you can read more in Part 2. | Forecast Uncertainty, Confidence Interval or Prediction Interval . The forecast we obtain in Power BI is the mean forecast. Time series is a statistical process and thus has probability distribution. When we create a forecast, we are estimating the mean of that forecast distribution, i.e 50% probability values. What about the other percentiles? . Power BI lets you choose the Confidence Interval (CI). You can choose from 75%, 80%, 85%, 95%, 99%. The 2014 blog talks about using confidence interval for assessing forecast accuracy. . &#39;...The shaded area shows you the range of predicted values at different confidence levels...&#39; . I think Power BI is calculating the Prediction Interval (PI) based on above description and not CI. You are actually choosing the confidence values for the PI. Let me explain the difference between the two and why it is important. . When you calculate CI, you are creating a confidence interval around the mean forecast. For example, the first mean forecast above is 813, upper bound is 864 and lower bound is 762. If it is CI, it does not mean the forecast will be between 864 and 762, 95% of the time. What it means is that based on the optimized parameters used in the model, limited sample size etc., the mean will be between 864 and 761. It&#39;s the error in estimating the mean. It&#39;s true that the band gives you an estimation of the range of mean values but it&#39;s not the range of the predicted values if it is CI. Prediction intervals (PI) are wider than CI. CI&#39;s are used to estimate error in a parameter of the population , e.g. mean, median, percentile, even PI values. It&#39;s not a range of predicted values. . I will give you an example, let&#39; say you work in an office where 1000 people work and you are asked what&#39;s the average work experience in years for the company. You go and ask 25 people about their years of experience, take an average and come up with 12.5 and standard dev of 2.3. Because you only asked 25 people, you know there is an error. You can estimate that error using CI and it is [11.6, 13.4] at 95%. This means the &quot;mean&quot; will be between 11.6 and 13.4 95% of the time but the actual &quot;range&quot; of experience would be far greater depending on the distribution. You might have people with 1 month experience to 30+ years experience, that&#39;s PI. Note that PI can be close to CI but not always. CI doesn&#39;t take model uncertainty into account and has little to no value in practical forecasting. . . Based on the 1 line description in the blog and the tests I have done, I think Power BI is calculating the PI, at least I hope so. This is why Power BI should release more documentation on this topic. . How is PI calculated? . Hyndman has provided calculations for estimating the PI. It assumes the residuals are normal, which may not always be the case. Simulations can be used for better results as it doesn&#39;t assume distribution of the residuals. I calculated the PI using simulation in Part 2 as [923, 691] which is slightly wider than the CI from Power BI [864,762]. . Also note that the PI &amp; CI grow with the forecast horizon. The farther you are into the future, the more uncertainty you have in the estimates. . Below I calculated the PI using R. As you can see they are slightly wider than Power BI&#39;s range but close. . %%R -i train -o fets library(fpp2) r_train &lt;- ts(train$Sales, start=c(2012,01), frequency=4) fets &lt;- r_train %&gt;% ets() %&gt;% forecast(h=6, simulate=TRUE, level= 95) %&gt;% summary() .

Implementation in Power BI with Python . Power BI created a reasonable forecast but it can be improved. If you want to further improve this forecast, you can use the &quot;Ensemble Forecast&quot; discussed in Part 2. . Perhaps the biggest limitation of forecasting in Power BI is not being able to access the forecast values for further calculations or reporting. It doesn&#39;t even show the forecast on the line chart. . We can use this Python code in Power BI for forecasting. Watch the video below. I have uploaded this Power BI file to my Github for your reference. . You need statsmodels, numpy, pandas libraries installed. . #hide_output # &#39;dataset&#39; holds the input data for this script import numpy as np from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.exponential_smoothing import ExponentialSmoothing h = 4 #forecast horizon model=ExponentialSmoothing(np.log(dataset[&quot;Sales&quot;]),trend=True,initialization_method= &#39;heuristic&#39;,seasonal=4,damped_trend=True).fit() fc=np.exp(model.predict(0,len(dataset)+(h-1))) dates=pandas.date_range(start=&#39;2012-03-31&#39;, periods= len(dataset)+h , freq=&#39;Q&#39;) df=pandas.DataFrame({&#39;dates&#39;:dates,&#39;Actual&#39;:dataset[&quot;Sales&quot;],&#39;Forecast&#39;:fc}) . We are using the same Python model we used earlier but we have to create a new dataframe for the additional values created by the forecast. Note that in this case, I am also obtaining the fittedvalues to inspect the fit over the data. If you only care about the forecast, change the code to model.forecast(4) .

Note: If you have not installed or used Python in Power BI before, read the documentation first. Also read these performance tips by David Eldersveld . . Tip: I recommend creating virtual environments and using (e.g. pynenv) for Power BI specific virtual environment . . Python in Power BI Limitations: . If you are not familiar with Python or don&#39;t have access to Python at work, this obvisouly won&#39;t work for you | For Python scripts to work properly in Power BI service, all data sources need to be set to &quot;Public&quot;. That&#39;s a BIG NO. | If you use Pyhon script in Power Query, you have to use a personal gateway. That may not be a problem but if you are using dataflow in your report, this solution won&#39;t work as dataflow needs Enterprise Gateway | Python script cannot be used on merged queries, you will get an error. You can merge after the Python script but not before. | The exponential_smoothing() can resturn confidence interval (see Part 2) but as we discussed above, it&#39;s of no practical use. It does not calculate prediction interval. We can use simulation to get prediction interval but it takes few minutes so can&#39;t practially be used as a Python script in Power BI. | Using R in Power BI . Leila Etaati has covered forecasting using R in great details, so I won&#39;t cover it here. But personally I find the forecast(), fpp2(), fable() libraries in R to be much faster, easier to work with and they do return prediction interval. Plus, unlike Python,ets() can be used for &quot;multiplicative&quot; models. . Using Excel . Excel has FORECAST.ETS() formula which uses ETS(AAA) method to create the forecast, just like Power BI. Power BI could be using the same algorithm under the hood because the options and results are very identical. Forecast Sheet under &quot;Data&quot; can be used for creating forecast with a UI. You can import this excel in Power BI and create a line chart almost exactly same as Power BI. . ETS can&#39;t be used for high-frequency data anyway so you would only need to update the Excel sheet once a month, quarter, year etc. so it shouldn&#39;t be a big problem. You can also use Power Automate to refresh the Excel on a schedule. . If you are ok with the limitations of ETS(AAA) model discussed above or find that ETS(AAA) can produce accurate results for your data, I think this is the easiest method to show forecast in Power BI. . . Other Options . SQL: If you are using SQL as a datasource, you can use RevoScalePy/RevoScaleR in SQL to serve any machine learning model including forecasting . KNIME: KNIME is an open-source tool used for productionizing data science projects. It&#39;s free, easy to use, can be used for ETL and the best part is that it has a Power BI integration. You can create a forecasting model (it&#39;s own ETS, ARIMA nodes or R/Python) and push the results to Power BI. If you need a more complex model, this is a great option. I will cover this in a future blog post. . Azure ML: Azure ML Service has a direct integration with Power BI. You can create the model in Azure Notebook, Designer or AutoML. You can see an example here. In the next blog I will cover this in more detail. . Custom Visuals: There are some custom visuals in the Apps gallery but I generally never use custom visuals for data privacy and dependency reasons. . Summary . It&#39;s easy to create a forecast in Power BI but it is severely limited | You cannot show the forecasted values on the line chart | You do not know what preprocessing Power BI may have applied to the data (imputation, outlier removal etc.) | You cannot plot multiple columns or use second Y axis when Forecast is used | You cannot use the &#39;Legend&#39; in the line chart with Forecast. Only works in Line Chart and not in &#39;Line &amp; Stacked column chart&#39; | You cannot extract the forecasted values for use in measures or calculated columns | Forecast can be exported as an excel file, re-imported to use the forecast but that would defeat the purpose of automatic forecasting | Power BI uses two ETS methods (AAN) and (AAA) which can be used for additive components but not when the trend, seasonality are non-linear | Power BI forecast should not be used on high-frequency data such as daily, hourly (even weekly if it exhibits multiple seasonalities) | Use at least data worth 3-4 seasons (&gt;12 for quarterly, &gt;36 for monthly data) | Power BI should provide more documentation on confidence interval and clarify if it is confidence interval or prediction interval. Until then, use it with caution. | If you do use Power BI&#39;s forecast tool, create a forecast first for time greater than or equal to your forecast horizon, use the same number in the &#39;Ignore Last&#39; points, assess the fit and calculate RMSE. If the fit looks good, you can use it for final forecast. | Always enter the seasonality manually | Do not use Power BI forecast on intermittent data with several 0&#39;s. | Excel might provide the easiest way to create an ETS(AAA) forecast. But has the same limitations as discussed above for ETS in general. | You can use Pyhton and R for generating forecasts in and outside of Power BI. R can give mean forecast and the prediction interval. For Pyhton, use simulations to generate PI. | References: .

            "content": "Overview . In Part 1, I did exploratory data analysis of sales time series of a French retailer. In this blog I will apply various time series models in Python and R to forecast sales for the next 4 quarters. The forecasting methods I will cover are: . Seasonal Naive | Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt Winter&#39;s) | ETS (State Space Error Trend Seasonality) | SARIMA | Facebook Prohet | Ensemble Forecast | . For each of these models, I will provide a short description for intuitive understanding of these methods and give references for more academic explanation. For any forecasting model, the general steps are as below. . Forecasting Steps . EDA | Forecast on test set | Evaluate the forecast Use appropriate evaluation metric (%MAPE, RMSE, AIC) | Plot the forecast against train and test data set | . | Check residuals. . Plot residuals, plot ACF/PACF and Q/Q plots | Conditions A, B below are essential and C,D are useful. Residuals should be: . Uncorrelated | Have zero (or close to zero) mean | Constant variance | Normally distributed | | First two ensure that there is no more information that can be extracted from the data, while the bottom two keep the variability in the point forecast narrow . | . | Select model(s) Forecast future series | Prediction Interval | . | Evaluation Metric . We evaluate the forecasting model by comparing the fitted &amp; predicted values against the actual values in training and test sets. Note that residuals are the difference between training data and fitted values, while forecast error is the difference between test data and predicted values. We use residuals to check performance of the model while errors for checking accuracy/uncertainty of the future forecast. . As a general rule, if the data has no outliers RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is a good metric to use. %MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) provides a more inutitive understanding as it is expressed in percentage. We do not use %MAPE if the series is intermittent to avoid division by zero. Note that both these measures are not scale independent but to keep things simple I will use RSME and MAPE. . .

Seasonal Naive . Seasonal naive method uses the observations from the corresponding season from last period. For example, forecast Q3 would be sales from Q3 last year. It does not take any trend or previous history into account. This method, as expected, is not the most accurate but helps create a baseline. As we explore more complex models, we want them to perform better than this and compare them with seasonal naive forecast. . . This method is not available in statsmodels library so I wrote a function for it. . def pysnaive(train_series,seasonal_periods,forecast_horizon): &#39;&#39;&#39; Python implementation of Seasonal Naive Forecast.

Seasonal naive forecast actually performs quite well considering it&#39;s just a logical forecasting method and there is no statistical procedure involved. | Model captures seasonality and general trend quite well but under forecasts (underfitting) | Training RMSE is 80.3 and test RMSE is 92 which is less than the standard deviation of the training set (111). | Residual analysis shows residuls are not stationary and have non-zero mean. Residual plot clearly shows that the model hasn&#39;t extracted the trend and seasonal behaviour as well as we would like. Though visually the model seems to perform well, it&#39;s not a useful model on its own | Non-zero mean can be fixed by adding the mean back to the forecasts as explained here but in this case the mean is significantly away from zero. | We could perhaps fit an AR model to the residuals to get more out of it. If you look at the ACF plot, it shows no lags are significant but the PACF plot (see below) shows 4,9,10,11,12 are significant. This is an AR process signature. Thus, if we want to capture information and make this model useful, we can fit an AR model to the residuals to create a 2 layer model | This shows importance of always checking the residuals after fitting the model | #PACF of Seasonal Snaive model residuals plot_acf(py_snaive_resid); plot_pacf(py_snaive_resid); . Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winter&#39;s Method) . Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt Winter&#39;s method) decomposes the series into level, trend, seasonality. Future values are predicted by combining these systematic factors based on recent history. The intuitive idea here is that the future will behave very similar to recent past, we just have to find how much of the past is relevant. The three systematic components are: . Level, (alpha): Average value around which the series varies. For a seasonal time series, level is obtained by first de-seasonalizing the series and then averaging. Alpha value determines how much of the past to consider and is between [0,1]. alpha=1 means give importance only to the last data point (naive forecast) | Trend, (beta): Trend is how the level changes over time. Similar to alpha, a beta value closer to 1 indicates the model is considering only the recent trend. Trend also has a damping factor (phi) which determines how much of the recent trend to &#39;forget&#39;. Consider it as a de-rating factor on trend. | Seasonality (gamma): This factor models how the series behaves in each time period for full season. Recall that in the previous blog about EDA (Part 1), I calculated the seasonal factors. Gamma is the same thing. | . This method is called &quot;Exponential&quot; because each of the above factors give exponential weightage to the past values. . Additive model = (Level + Trend) + Seasonality . Multiplicative Model = (Level Trend) Seasonality . The Exponentialsmoothing() method in statsmodels finds the optimal alpha, beta, gamma and phi by minizing the errors. . . Additive vs Multiplicative . Depending on the temporal structure of the time series, trend and seasonality can show additive, multiplicative or mix behaviour. . In case of trend, if the time series has linear trend, it&#39;s additive. If it is exponentially increasing (power law), a multiplicative model might fit better. . Seasonality is calculated relative to the level. If a series has additive seasonality, each season varies +/- relative to the level. E.g. in a quarterly series, in Q1 we might add +30 more units, -60 in Q2, +120 in Q3 and +60 in Q4 relative to level. Thus, seasonality peaks have somehwat fix height relative to level everywhere. On the other hand, in a multiplicative seasonality, the quantities will vary by %, i.e +5% in Q1, -7% in Q2, +10% in Q3 and +5 in Q4 relative to trend. As the level increases or decreases, seasonality can vary by %. . For this time series, we identified during EDA (Part 1) that trend is exponential. Seasonality can be modeled as additive or multiplicatives. Note that we can turn a multiplicative component into additive by taking log or using power transform (BoxCox). This is often preferred and may perform better. . Refer to Part 1 where I calculated these seasonality factors. . I replicated an illustration from Everette Gardener&#39;s paper to show this effect below. I highly recommend reading it if you are ineterested in exponential smoothing. . . Grid Searching Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winter&#39;s Method) . Instead of fitting each model individually, I wrote a custom function HWGrid() to perform uniform, gridsearch using the model parameters. This function also returns statistics on residuals (Ljung Box test, Normality test and mean). You get model evaluation metric and residual metric for 24 models. This may take a while (5-15 min) on your computer. . m=HWGrid(train[&quot;Sales&quot;], test[&quot;Sales&quot;], seasonal_periods=4) . m .

Above resulting dataframe is sorted in ascending order showing model with lowest test RMSE and %MAPE at the top. Cells highlighted in green are the lowest numbers in their respective columns. Some observations from this result: . Train RMSE is much smaller than test RMSE, showing all the models perform far better on training set than test set | Models with additive trend and BoxCox=log are at the top. This confirms the finding from the EDA that the trend was more than linear. By taking the &#39;log&#39;, trend is linearized and thus &quot;additive&quot; model can be used. | The top model [&quot;add&quot;, &quot;add&quot;, True, False] performed the worst on the train set. AICc is also the highest. | Top 5 models have used &#39;log&#39; transformation and generally have very similar performance on the test set. | All models except one at the bottom as Uncorrelated residuals. Recall that model with uncorrelated residuals has captured as much information as it can from the available data. | All models are biased (non-zero mean). Ideally we want the model to have zero mean but in this case the means are small and should be added to the forecast to correct the bias. | All models have residuals that are normal. This is a useful but not necessary condition. Having a model with normal residuals can make prediction interval calculations easier. | Model selection should always be done by comparing test evaluation metric and not by comparing residual diagnostic metrics. | Top and fourth model has high AICc. Third and fifth have almost same performance. We want to select a parsimonious and simple model. I will select the model with additive seasonality and trend as it has the lowest AICc in the top 5 models. | hw_model = ExponentialSmoothing(train[&quot;Sales&quot;], trend =&quot;add&quot;, seasonal = &quot;add&quot;, seasonal_periods=4, damped=False).fit(use_boxcox=&#39;log&#39;) hw_fitted = hw_model.fittedvalues hw_resid = hw_model.resid #Adding the mean of the residuals to correct the bias. py_hw = hw_model.forecast(len(test[&quot;Sales&quot;])) + np.mean(hw_resid) predictions[&quot;py_hw&quot;] = py_hw #Holt-Winter Parameters hw_model.params_formatted . name param optimized . smoothing_level alpha | 7.538529e-01 | True | . smoothing_slope beta | 3.568007e-09 | True | . smoothing_seasonal gamma | 0.000000e+00 | True | . initial_level l.0 | 6.094620e+00 | True | . initial_slope b.0 | 3.675604e-02 | True | . initial_seasons.0 s.0 | -2.463472e-01 | True | . initial_seasons.1 s.1 | -2.036851e-01 | True | . initial_seasons.2 s.2 | -9.372556e-02 | True | . initial_seasons.3 s.3 | -3.542245e-01 | True | .

Cross-Validation . In the above gridsearch, the training set size was fix and we evaluated the model performance by comparing train AICc, RMSE, %MAPE and test RMSE &amp; %MAPE. Test metrics provides true forecast accuracy and should always be used for model selection. This is the preferred approach when the data size is large. But when the time series is short, cross-validation should be used to make sure the model does not overfit the data. The two common approaches are: . Expanding window cross-validation: We start with some initial training &amp; test sets and with each iteration we add one observation to the training set. Forecast errors are calculated with each iteration and averaged to compare model performance. This simulates the performance of the model as we add more observations. For the final forecast we will using all the available history, so using expanding window gives us a good estimate of the forecast accuracy and uncertainty. . | Rolling Window cross-validation: Similar to Expanding but the training size remains same, instead it moves by one observation each time. Training and test lengths remain same. . | Note that AICc, theoretically, provides the same information because it penalizes complex models that overfit. . . #I would like to perform 5 fold cross validation, want the training size to be at #least 12 and test window = forecast horizon 24 - 4 - 5 = 15.

ETS standards for Error, Trend, Seasonality model (I have also seen some refer to it as ExponenTial Smoothing). It is similar to Holt-Winter&#39;s model above but with a State Space statistical framework. In HoltWinter&#39;s, the time series is decomposed into trend and seasonality and exponential weights are used to make the forecast. In a State Space approach, the underlying statistical process is identified and errors are factored in to make the forecast. Holt, Single Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winter&#39;s, certain ARIMA models can all be categorised into ETS class models. . ETS models follow a taxonomy of ETS(XYZ) where: . X:Error (aka innovations). It can be Additive (A) or Multiplicative (M) | Y:Trend. Trend component can be No trend (N), additive (A), Multiplicative (M) or damped (Ad) | Z:Seasonality, Null (N), additive (A) or multiplicative (M) | . Thus, ETS(ANN) is an exponential model with additive error, no trend, no seasonality (i.e single exponential smoothing) and ETS(MAM) is analogous to Holt-Winter&#39;s method described above. There can be 24 different ETS models based on above combinations but not all combinations of ETS are stable, especially when error is multiplicative. . statsmodels() has a statespace implementation of exponential smoothing method in its tsa.statespace() class. It only has addditive error, additive &amp; damped trend models for now (as of 4/20/2020). Recall that we can convert a multiplicative model into additive by power transform, so this is not a problem. . Using statespace (ETS) can often work better than Holt Winter because of how the parameters are initialized and optimized. This can make a huge difference in the results as we will see. ETS framework also returns 95% predictive interval which HW does not. . Refer to ch.7 of Hyndman&#39;s book for a quick refrence on ETS models and this for more detailed explanation. .

Observations . ETS model performed significantly better than Holt-Winter&#39;s, despite the fact that they both perform exponential smoothing. RSME is 40.9 compared to 86 for HOlt Winter&#39;s. | The primary reason why ETS performs better is the parameter initialization &amp; optimization. Holt Winter&#39;s minimizes the residual error whereas ETS optimizes likelihood. ETS is more likely to obtain global minima faster &amp; more accurately. This doesnt mean ETS will always be better, but in general it should perform better. | Residuals are uncorrelated, normally distributed with 0 mean. | The model struggled initially with a poor fit but it learned the systematic components very well and does an excellent job on the test set | Our observations from EDA and HW model informed the choice to take a log of the training set.

This was the main reason I chose this model and the reason will be apparent later as we explore more models. | SARIMA (Seasonal, Auto-Regressive, Integrated, Moving Average Model) . SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) is a classical, statistical forecasting method that predicts the forecast values based on past values, i.e lagged values (AR) and lagged errors (MA). Unlike Holt-Winter&#39;s (or ETS), it needs the time series to be stationary before it can be used. That&#39;s where the &quot;Integrated&quot; part comes from. &quot;Integration&quot; means differecning the series to remove trend and make it stationary. You can learn amore about the fundamentals by watching below video. Prof. Shmueli also has an excellent book on Forecasting that I highly recommend. . I also recommend this free Coursera course Practical Time Series Analysis if you want to gain practical and intutitive understanding of ARIMA models. . I will share my main take-aways from these and other resources I have used. . . Auto-regression, AR(p): . As the name suggests, it&#39;s the linear regression with its past values | AR (p) =&gt; Current value = mean + fraction (phi) of yesterday&#39;s value + fraction (phi) of day before yesterday&#39;s value +......+ fraction of pth day&#39;s value + noise | If phi is negaitive =&gt; mean inversion, i.e today&#39;s value will likely go down after yesterday&#39;s peak. | If phi is positive =&gt; Momentum | If phi = 0 =&gt; white noise | If phi = 1 =&gt; random walk | phi has to be between [-1,1] for process to be stationary | If the PACF plot cuts off sharply at lag k, while there is a gradual decay in ACF, it&#39;s a AR(p) process. [Note: I keep PACF and AR(P) mnemonic in mind to know which plot to use for identifying AR process) | An AR(1) model is equivalent to MA(infinity) model, (practially q&gt;&gt;50) | Below video explain AR process really well . . Moving Average ,MA(q): . MA process is not the same as taking moving average of a series | MA process is made up of white noise at different times. In MA(q), q tells us how far back along the sequence of white noise we have to loo for weighted average | For example, in our case if the series is an MA(q) process, the forecast is not affected by the previous sales but rather errors in past forecast. | MA processes are not common but when combined with AR, can produce very accurate forecasts | For an MA(q) model, the forecast beyond 1 period will be the same for rest of the forecast horizon | To identify MA(q) process, plot the ACF. If it sharply cuts off at qth lag, it&#39;s an MA(q) process | Thus, ARIMA (p,d,q) = constant + (weighted sum of last p values) + (weighted sum of last q values of forecast errors) after d differencing . Below are the simulated MA and AR processes. If you run this cell a few times and observe the plots, you will not that it&#39;s not possible to distinguish an AR from MA by just looking at the plots. You need to study the ACF &amp; PACF to know the difference. . #Simulating AR process from statsmodels.tsa.arima_process import ArmaProcess ar = np.array([1,-0.9]) ma = np.array([1, 0.9]) AR = ArmaProcess(ar=ar, ma=None) MA = ArmaProcess(ar=None, ma=ma) simulated_AR= AR.generate_sample(125) simulated_MA= MA.generate_sample(125) fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2) # fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,8)) fig.suptitle(&#39;Simulated AR &amp; MA Processes&#39;) ax1.plot(simulated_AR); ax2.plot(simulated_MA); . Finding the parameters of the ARIMA process (p,d,q) is an art and science. Generally, p+q &lt;=3. Similar to ARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) has (P,D,Q) parameters, so SARIMA is (p,d,q)(P,D,Q). p+d+q+P+D+Q &lt;=6 (generally) . Instead of finding the above parameters manually by studying the ACF, PACF, we usually use grid searching just like HW method above. pmdarima is a great library for SARIMA forecasting in Python. It returns the parameters that minimizes AICc and also has cross-validation tools.statsmodels has arma_order_select_ic() for identifying order of the ARMA model but not for SARIMA. . Let&#39;s first take a look at the ACF and PACF to identify potential order of the SARIMA model . ACF plot shows that 1st lag is significant (outside the blue band), the ACFs and PACF both decrease gradually. We will need at least 1 differencing to make the series stationary. When ACF and PACF plots do not have sharp cut offs and significant lags at higher orders, its a indication of ARMA process with seasonality. . plot_acf(train[&quot;Sales&quot;]); plot_pacf(train[&quot;Sales&quot;]); .

In this example, ARIMA worked better but that may not always be the case and you won&#8217;t know until you experiment. . Facebook Prophet . Facebook described Prophet library as below in their documentation: . &quot; Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.&quot; . Video below gives great overview of this package. . . My main take aways are: . Prophet was built for high frequency data like daily, hourly, minute etc.. It may not work very well on monthly, quarterly data, but you won&#39;t know until you try. | In addition to forecasting, it also provide changepoints, anomalies which are great for detecting sudden changes in the time series | Prof. Kourentzes tested Prophet along with other methods (ETS, SARIMA) on M3 competition data and found that Prophet performed poorly. | ETS/HW &amp; SARIMA cannot work with multiple seasonalities &amp; high frequency data. Prophet can also include effect of holidays. | Prophet requires the data to be in specific format. Dataframe must have time column ds and time series observations in column y | Though Prophet is designed mainly for high frequency data, it can be used for monthly/quarterly/yearly data with some tweaks. | from fbprophet import Prophet data_fb = data.reset_index() data_fb.columns=[&#39;ds&#39;,&#39;y&#39;] #create new df with columns ds &amp; y train_fb, test_fb = data_fb.iloc[:-len(test)], data_fb.iloc[-len(test):] #create train &amp; test df . #Fit the model to train fb1_model=Prophet(weekly_seasonality=False, daily_seasonality=False, n_changepoints=10, seasonality_mode=&quot;multiplicative&quot;).fit(train_fb) #I tried &quot;additive too&quot;, it was slightly worse #Prophet results are saved to a dataframe using make_future_dataframe() fb1_df=fb1_model.make_future_dataframe(6, freq=&#39;Q&#39;) #set the freq argument to &#39;Q&#39; for quarterly data #We only need &quot;ds&quot; and &quot;yhat&quot; columns.. &quot;ds&quot; is the date column and &quot;yhat&quot; are predictions fb1_fc_df=fb1_model.predict(fb1_df)[[&quot;ds&quot;,&quot;yhat&quot;]] fb1_fc__=fb1_model.predict(fb1_df) #Residuals fb1_resid = train[&quot;Sales&quot;].values - fb1_fc_df[&#39;yhat&#39;].iloc[:len(train)] fb1_fc = fb1_fc_df.iloc[-len(test):] predictions[&quot;fb1&quot;] = fb1_fc[&quot;yhat&quot;].values . fb1_fc_df.head() . ds yhat . 0 2012-03-31 | 362.0 | . 1 2012-06-30 | 385.0 | . 2 2012-09-30 | 432.0 | . 3 2012-12-31 | 341.0 | . 4 2013-03-31 | 382.0 | .

SNaive &amp; Prophet are below the test while SARIMA and HW are above. AAdA is also below actual in Q3. | HW &amp; SARIMA are almost identical | If we had to pick a single best model, we would use the Log AAdA model which has the lowest RMSE and tracks the actual values very closely. | SARIMA did well on the test set but not so good on the early part of the training set. That&#39;s acceptable but the point is that all these methods did well in training or test. Thus, a better approach is to create an ensemble forecast that combines all or some of these forecasts together. | Many research studies have shown that forecast combination often provides a more robust, accurate forecast that&#39;s less susceptible to overfitting. You can read more here | Ensemble Forecasts . Although there are many different ways to combine forecasts, simple averaging often works as good as a more complex methods and is easier to implement/monitor/debug. As we saw above, some forecasts are above the test and some are below. So hopefully averaging will bring it closer to the actual values. . We have 7 different models with more than 200 possible combinations. Let&#39;s compare their RSME with fc_combo() function I wrote. This function averages the forecasts and calculates the RSME. . . Note: This function uses mean() to average the forecasts but you should try median() as well. Depending on the data and the skewness, meadian() might work better in some cases. . forecasts .

Observations: . The best performing model is (&#39;AAdA&#39;, &#39;sarima_log&#39;, &#39;fb1&#39;) with RMSE = 33.3 which is better than the best solo model LogAAdA (RSME:40) but not by very much. | Notice how some of the individual models that gave very poor forecasts (Seasonal Naive, HW, SARIMA) but when combined with other forecasts, performed very well. Similarly the models that performed the best LogAAdA, SARIMA_Log did not create the best combination forecast. | Diversity of models in forecast combination makes the forecast more robust, typically produce normally distributed errors and narrower prediction intervals. Follow the research work by Prof. Kourentzes for theory and practical advise on forecast combination. | More models in combination does not mean better results. When selecting combinations, focus should be on divertsity of the models selected (different class of models). Some researchers (Armstrong et al) have suggested using 5 models. | This shows the value of experimentation in any statistical /Machine Learning project. | Final Model . For the final model, we use all the data and not just the training set. If we want a single best model we will choose the Log ETS(A,Ad,A). The best combination model is (&#39;AAdA&#39;, &#39;sarima_log&#39;, &#39;fb1&#39;) which has the lowest RMSE. The difference between them is not significant when accuracy is compared. In the next blog, I am going to demonstrate how to deploy this forecasting model in PowerBI &amp; AzureML so to keep things simple, I will use the Log ETS(A,Ad,A) model. Also, ETS allows simulations which can be used for aggregate forecasting and communicating uncertainty. Forecast combination is a fascinating topic and deserves a seperate blog post. .

Forecast Uncertainty . Forecasts are based on history and are probabilistic. When creating and communicating the forecasts, it is important that the stakeholders who will be using the forecasts understand the uncertainty in the estimates. Forecasts have four sources of uncertainties: . Random error | Parameters used in the model | Model choice | Data uncertainty | While it&#39;s not possible to estimate all sources of uncertainties, the forecaster should provide enough information/tools to the stakeholders to understand and gauge the risk in using the forecast. Stochastic simulation can be used for risk modeling. . Simulation . Imagine that the stakeholders are interested in the aggregate sales for 2018, i.e the total sales and not just the quarterly sales. The obvious way is to calculate quarterly forecasts, like we did, and then summing them up to get annual sales. While this may provide a good estimate, it will not be correct. Since the quarterly forecasts are distributions, we need to account for the variance in those distributions when calculating the aggregates. If the forecasts were based on median or percentile, we cannot simply add them up. Also, it&#39;s possible that not all forecasts are from normal distributions and thus cannot be added. . Monte Carlo simulation can be used to overcome these challenges. Below we will generate 5000 future forecasts based on the ETS model we have and then calculate the aggregates, prediction intervals and cumulative distribution function for it. . #Simulating 5000 futures sim_frame=ets_model.simulate(4, anchor=&#39;2018-03-31&#39;, repetitions=5000 ).T.reset_index().iloc[:,2:].apply(np.exp).round(1) sim_frame[&quot;aggregate&quot;] = sim_frame.sum(axis=1) sim_frame.tail() . 2018-03-31 00:00:00 2018-06-30 00:00:00 2018-09-30 00:00:00 2018-12-31 00:00:00 aggregate . 4995 632.1 | 858.9 | 868.6 | 804.4 | 3164.0 | . 4996 732.0 | 741.2 | 1019.0 | 698.6 | 3190.8 | . 4997 721.6 | 914.4 | 938.7 | 785.9 | 3360.6 | . 4998 627.2 | 868.6 | 882.2 | 728.8 | 3106.8 | . 4999 585.7 | 905.0 | 873.0 | 765.6 | 3129.3 | . mean_2018_sales = np.mean(sim_frame[&quot;aggregate&quot;]) print(&quot;25th percntile Sales for FY2018:&quot;,np.quantile(sim_frame[&quot;aggregate&quot;], 0.25).round(0)) print(&quot; nAvg Sales for FY2018, Simulation:&quot;,mean_2018_sales.round(0)) print(&quot; n75th percntile Sales for FY2018:&quot;,np.quantile(sim_frame[&quot;aggregate&quot;], 0.75).round(0)) print(&quot; nFY2018 Based on Quarterly Forecasts:&quot;,results_df[&quot;mean&quot;].sum().round(0)) . 25th percntile Sales for FY2018: 3084.0 Avg Sales for FY2018, Simulation: 3163.0 75th percntile Sales for FY2018: 3241.0 FY2018 Based on Quarterly Forecasts: 3157.0 . As you can see, if we just summed up the quarterly forecasts, the aggregate for 2018 would be 3157, and if we used the simulations it would be 3163. In this case the difference is not much and is within the forecast error but that may not always be the case. . When communicating forecasts (or any other uncertainty), providing range is a better solution than providing point estimates. e.g. we calculated the 25% &amp; 75% percentile for the aggregate forecast. Thus, we could say that we are 50% confident that the FY2018 sales would be between 3083 and 3240.i.e P50 [3083 , 3240]. This can also be interpreted as there is only 25% chance that Sales would be &gt;3240 next year. This conveys the uncertainty far better than point estimates. . Confidence Interval vs. Prediction Interval . It&#39;s common to calculate and show 95% confidence around the mean forecast. 95% is a conventional measure and doesn&#39;t have any particular significance. Confidence interval (CI)is not the same as prediction interval (PI). CI is often confused as a measure of uncertainty and is used to show the upper and lower bound for the estimate - it&#39;s not! . Confidence interval is around the populatio point estimate. e.g. if we calculate the mean, to convey the error in calculating it we compute the CI. In our case the mean for Q1 is 692.5 and lower and upper CI bound are [599.8,799.5]. We are 95% confident that the mean will be within this bound. This doesn&#39;t say the forecast will be between these bounds with 95% confidence. Think of CI as error around the population point estimate because of limited sample size. CI will be lower if increase the sample size or lower the alpha. Point estimate means calculating a single number e.g. mean, median, percentile etc. about the population/sample. Also make a note if the CI is calculated using parameters of the models (residuals). . To calculate the upper and lower bound on the forecast, we need prediction interval. PI can be calculated using the forecast errors or simulations. PI gives us the upper and lower bounds based on the model we have created. By definition PI &gt; CI. In our examle, the 97.5th percentile is 923 and 2.5% percentils is 691. Now we can be 95% confident that the forecast for Q1 2018 will be between 923 and 691 ! . Many years ago at the end of my Business Simulations class in grad school, Prof.Nelson said the main take-away from his class should be the difference between PI and CI and correct use/interpretation of CI. I hope after reading this blog, among other things, you will also learn to interprete CI correctly, especially in the context of forecasting. CI is useless for forecasting. . q1_975=np.quantile(sim_frame.iloc[:,1],0.975) q1_025=np.quantile(sim_frame.iloc[:,1],0.025) print(&quot;PI_95%:&quot;, q1_95.round(1)) print(&quot;PI_5%:&quot;, q1_05.round(1)) .

This is a dynamic and interactive way for the stakeholders to understand forecast uncertainty. For example, if this French retailer has a Revenue target at least 3300, they have only 12% (1-0.88) chance of achiveing that based on this forecating model. The stakeholders will find this more beneficial for decision making than the typical static forecast chart. You could create similar chart for all quarters and make it more interactive. Power BI can be used for that. . Forecast Using R . Import rpy2 .

We obtained the same SARIMA order as Python ARIMA(0,1,0)(1,1,0)[4] . Conclusion . We explored various time series forecasting methods, model selection procedures and created an ensemble forecast that can be used to improve the forecast accuracy. We also briefly covered communicating uncertainty in forecasts. I did not include any deep-learning methods as they generally do well on large dataset with multiple features. Classical methods such as HW/ETS &amp; ARIMA provide more interpretable results which can prove useful for understanding the behaviour of the time time series and make business decisions. In the next blog I will cover deploying this model in PowerBI. . References: .

Train Test Split: . Before analyzing the data, first split it into train and test (hold-out) for model evaluation. All the EDA and model fitting/selection should be done first using train data. Never look at the test sample until later to avoid any bias. Typically we want at least 3-4 full seasonal cycles for training, and test set length should be no less than the forecast horizon. . In this example, we have 24 observations of the quarterly data, which means 6 full cycles (24/4). Our forecast horizon is 4 quarters. So training set should be more than 16 and less than 20. I will use first 18 observations for training and keep last 6 for validation.Note that I am always selecting the last 6 values for test by using .iloc[:-6]. As we get more data, this will ensure that last 6 values are always for validation. Unlike typical train/test split, we can not shuffle the data before splitting to retain the temporal structure. . Cross-validation: . Data can be split using the above method or using cross-validation where the series is split into number of successive segments and the model is tested using one-step ahead forecast. Model accuracy in that case is based on the mean of the cross-validation errors over the number of splits used. This minimizes chances of overfitting. Be sure to include at least 1-2 seasonal periods to capture the seasonality. e.g. in this case, the first training set of the CV should be min 8 values so the model has captured seasonal behaviour from 2 years. This is the preferred method when the time series is short. . Our series has 24 obervations so I can use last 6-8 for validation. When the typical train/test split is used, always check the sensisitivity of the model performance and model parameters to train/test size. If AIC or AICc is used for model evaluation, it approximatley approaches cross-validation error asymptotically. I will cover this in Part 2 with the code and example. . . #Split into train and test train = data.iloc[:-6] test = data.iloc[-6:] #forecast horizon h = 6 train_length = len(train) print(&#39;train_length:&#39;,train_length, &#39; n test_length:&#39;, len(test) ) . train_length: 18 test_length: 6 . train.head() .

These are some of the questions I ask at various stages of model building. . Are there any null values? how many? best way to impute the null data? If null/NaNs are present, first identify why the data is missing and if NaNs mean anything. Missing values can be filled by interpolation, forward-fill or backward-fill depending on the data and context. Also make sure null doesnt mean 0, which is acceptable but has modeling implications. | It&#39;s important to understand how the data was generated (manual entry, ERP system), any transformations, assumptions were made before providing the data. | . | Are the data/dates continuous? In this exmaple I am only looking at continous time-series. There other methods that deal with non-continuous data. ETS &amp; ARIMA require the data to be continuous. If the series is not continuous, we can add dummy data or use interpolation. | . | Are there any duplicate dates, data? Remove the duplicates or aggregate the data (e.g. average or mean) to treat duplicates | . | Any &#39;potential&#39; outliers? . Outliers are defined as observations that differ significantly from the general observations. Identify if the data is susceptible to outliers/spikes, if outliers mean anything and how to define outliers. While &#39;Outlier Detection&#39; is a topic in itself, in forecasting context we want to treat outliers before the data is used for fitting the model. Both ETS and ARIMA class of models (especially ARIMA) are not robust to outliers and can provide erroneous forecasts. Data should be analyzed while keeping seasonality in mind. e.g. a sudden spike could be because of the seasonal behaviour and not be outlier. Do not confuse outlier with &#39;influential data&#39;. . | Few ways to treat outliers: . Winsorization: Use Box and whiskers and clip the values tha exceed 1 &amp; 99th percentile (not preferred) | Use residual standard deviation and compare against observed values (preferred but can&#39;t do a priori) | Use moving average to check spikes/troughs (iterative and not robust) | . | Another important reason to pay close attention to outliers is that we will choose the appropriate error metric based on that. There are many error metrics used to assess accuracy of forecasts, viz. MAE, MSE, RMSE, %MAPE, %sMAPE. If outliers are present, don&#39;t use RMSE because the squaring the error at the outlier value can inflate the RMSE. In that case model should be selected/assessed using %MAPE or %sMAPE. More on that in part 2. . | . | Visually any trend, seasonality, cyclic behaviour? This will help us choose the appropriate model (Single, Double, Triple Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA/SARIMA) | If cyclic behiour is present (seasonality is short-order variation e.g. month/quarter, cyclicity occurs over 10-20 years e.g. recession) we will need to use different type of decomposition (X11, STL). Depending on the context and purpose of analysis, seasoanlity adjustment may also be needed. | If multiple seasonalities are present, ETS or ARIMA cannot be used. SSA, TBATS, harmonic regression are more appropriate in that case. FB Prophet can also help with multiple seasonalities. | Frequency of seasonality is important. ETS &amp; SARIMAX are not appropriate for high frequency data such as hourly, daily, sub-daily and even weekly. Consider using SSA,TBTAS, FB Prophet, deep learning models. | . | How does the data change from season to season for each period and period to period and compared to the level? Does it increas/decrease with the trend? Changes slowly, rapidly or remains constant. This is an important observation to be made, especially for ETS model, as it can determine the parametrs to be used &amp; if any preprocessing will be needed. | De-compose the series into level, trend, seasonal components and residual error. Observe the patterns in the decomposed series. | Is the trend constant, growing/slowing linearly or exponentially or some other non-linear function? | Is the seasonal pattern repetitive? | How is the seasonal pattern changing relative to level? If it is constant relative to level, it shows &quot;additive&quot; seasonality, whereas if it is growing, it&#39;s &quot;multiplicative&quot;.(Part 2 covers this in detail) | . | Distribution of the data? will we need any transformations? While normally distributed data is not a requirement for forecasting and doesnt necessarily improve point forecast accuracy, it can help stablize the variance and narrow the prediction interval. | Plot the histogram/KDE for each time period (e.g. each year and each seasona) to get gauge peakedness, spread in the data. It can also help compare different periods and track trends over time. | If the data is severely skewed, consider normalizing the data before training the model. Be sure to apply inverse transformation on the forecasts. Use the same transformation parameters on the train and test sets. Stabilizing the variance by using Box Cox transformation (special case being log &amp; inverse transform), power law etc can help more than normalizing the data. | Watch out for outliers before transformation as it will affect the transformation | Plottng distribution also helps track &quot;concept-drift&quot; in the data, i.e. does the underlying temporal structure / assumption change over time. If the drift is significant, refit the model or at least re-evaluate. This can be tricky in time series analysis. | Uncertainty in the training data will lead to higher uncertainty in the forecast. If the data is highly volatile/uncertain (seen by spread in the distribution, standard deviation, non-constant variance etc), ETS and ARIMA models will not be suitable. Consider GARCH and other methods. | . | Is the data stationary? Is this a white noise, random walk process? . Perhaps the most important concept to keep in mind when doing time series analysis and forecasting is that, time series is a probabilistic / stochastic process, and the time series we are analyzing is a &#39;realization of a stochastic process&#39;. A time signal could be deterministic or stochastic/probabilistic. In a deterministic process, the future values can be predicted exactly with a mathematical function e.g. y = sin(2$ pi$ft). In our case, the future values can only be expressed in terms of probability distribution. The point estimates are mean/median of the distribution. By definition, the mean has a distribution around it and as such the stakeholders should be made aware of the probabilistic nature of the forecast through uncertainty estimates. . | Stationarity: Statistical stationarity means the time series has constant mean, variance and autocorrelation is insignificant at all lags. Autocorrelation is a mouthful, all it means is the correlation with its past self. e.g. to check if two variables are linearly correlated with each other, we calculate their coeff of correlation (Pearson correlation). Similarly, autocorrelation does the same thing but with its past values (i.e lags). More on that later. For a stationary time series, the properties are the same no matter which part of the series (w.r.t time) we look at. This is a core concept of the ARIMA methods, as only stationary processes can be modeled using ARIMA. ETS can handle non-stationary processes. . | White Noise: If a time series has zero mean and a constant variance , i.e. N(0,$ sigma^2$), it&#39;s a white noise. The variables in this case are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) and are uncorrelated. We want the residuals left after fitting the model to be a white noise. White noise can be identified by using ADFuller test and plotting autocorrelation function (ACF) plots. In an ACF plot, the autocorrelation should be insignificant (inside the 95% CI band) at all lags. | Random Walk: Random walks are non-stationary. Its mean or variance or both change over time. Random walk cannot be forecast because we have more unknowns than the data so we will end up having way too many parameters in the model. In essence, random walk has no pattern to it, it&#39;s last data point plus some random signal (drift). Thus, if the first difference of the time series results in a white noise, it&#39;s an indication of a Random Walk. e.g. most equity stocks are random walk but by looking at percent difference (%growth over time) we can study the white noise. `Next Data point = Previous Data Point + Random Noise` `Random Noise = Next Data Point - Previous Data Point` . | . | . . Note: It&#8217;s easy to mistake randomness for seasonality. In the random walk chart below, it can appear that the data has some seasonality but does not! . #collapse-hide #create white noise with N(0,1.5), 500 points np.random.seed(578) steps = np.random.normal(0,1,500) noise = pd.DataFrame({&quot;x&quot;:steps}) wnoise_chart = alt.Chart(noise.reset_index()).mark_line().encode( x=&#39;index&#39;, y=&#39;x&#39;).properties( title=&quot;White Noise&quot;) #Create random walk with N(0,1.5), 500 points steps[0]=0 rwalk = pd.DataFrame({&quot;x&quot;:100 + np.cumsum(steps)}).reset_index() rwalk_chart = alt.Chart(rwalk).mark_line().encode( x=&#39;index&#39;, y=alt.Y(&#39;x&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(domain=(80,150)))).properties( title=&quot;Random Walk&quot;) wnoise_chart | rwalk_chart . . Auto-correlation? at what lag? Study the second order properties (autocorrelation and power spectral density) of the time series along with mean, standard deviation, distribution. More details below. | . | If trend is present, momentum or mean-reversing? . Time series with momentum indicates the value tends to keep going up or down (relative to trend) depending on the immediate past. Series with mean-reversion indicates it will go up (or down) if it has gone down (or up) in the immediate past. This can be found by examining the coefficients of the ARIMA model. This provides more insight into the process and builds intuition. This doesnt not directly help with forecasting. | . | Break-points in the series? . Are there any structural breaks (shifts) in the series. Structural breaks are abrupt changes in the trend. Gather more information about the sudden changes. If the breaks are valid, ETS/ARIMA models wont work. FB Prophet, dynamic regression, deep learning models, adding more features might help. Identify the possible reasons for change, e.g. change in macros, price change, change in customer preferenaces etc. Note structural change persists for some time, while outliers do not. Break points are different from non-stationarity. Read more here for examples &amp; explanations. In case of structural break-points, consider modeling the segments of the series separately. | . | Intermittent demand? Time series is said to be intermittent when there are several 0 and small values (not nulls) in the series. ETS and ARIMA are not appropriate for this type of time series. It&#39;s a common pattern with inventory time series, especially for new items. Croston&#39;s method is one approach to use for forecasting intermittent demand. | When demand is intermittent, use RMSE rather than %MAPE as the evaluation metric. With %MAPE, the denominator would be 0 leading to erroneous results. | . | #collapse-hide #creating intermittent demand plot demand = [10, 12, 0, 3,50,0,0,18,0,4, 12,0,0,8,0,3] demanddf = pd.DataFrame({&#39;y&#39;: demand, &#39;x&#39;: np.arange(2000, 2016) } ) alt.Chart(demanddf).mark_bar().encode( x=&#39;x&#39;, y=&#39;y&#39;).properties( title=&quot;Example: Intermittent Demand&quot;, width = 700) . . Do we need any exogenous variables/external regressors? It may be necessary to include additional features/variables to accurately capture the time series behaviour. For example, the sales for a retailer might be higher on weekends, holidays, when it&#39;s warmer etc. This is different from seasonal pattern. In such cases, using the &#39;day of the week&#39; or &#39;is_holiday&#39; feature might provide better forecast. ETS models cannot use exogenous variable. SARIMAX (X is for exogenous), deep learning, XGB models are more suited. | Always inspect the residuals after fitting the model. If the residuals are correlated (use ACF/PACF plots, Ljung Box test on residuals), it&#39;s an indication that we are not capturing the time series behaviour accurately and could try adding exogenous behaviour. | . | Are the stakeholders interested in forecast for invidiuals periods or hierarchical forecast? Typically forecasts are made for individual periods, e.g in this example, we are interested in the forecasts for next 4 quarters. But it&#39;s possible that the business leaders might be more interested in the 1 year forecast rather than 4 quarters. We could combine the forecasts from 4 quarters to calculate the forecast for 1 year, but that would be incorrect. As mentioned above, time series is a statistical process with probability distribution. We can get reasonable value by summing the mean forecasts but the uncertainty around those forecasts cannot be added. Also, if the individual forecasts are based on the median (rather than mean), forecasts cannot be added. We will need to calculate &quot;hierarchical forecast* by simulating the future paths and then adding the distributions to get prediction interval. | . | Are forecast explainability &amp; interpretability important? Many traditional and statistical forecasting methods such as ETS, SARIMA are easy to apply, interprete and model parameters/results can help explain the time series behaviour. This can be important in scenarios where such insights can help make business decisions. e.g if an ETS model with damped trend fits better, it can be an indication of slowing growth etc. However, many other models such deep learning, RNN, S2S, LSTM etc are blackbox approaches that may lead to higher accuracy but provide little-to-no explainability. | . | EDA in Pyhton .

Seasonality Factor . This will help us understand how much each quarter contributes relative to the average demand. Note that this should be done on a de-trended series(taking first difference) but because we don&#39;t have enough data and for a quick demonstration, I am using the series as is. . #Groupby Sales by Quarter #Only use upto 2015 because we have partial data for 2016 train_2015=train[:&#39;2015&#39;] avg_2015= np.int(train[:&#39;2015&#39;].mean()) #Avg sales per quarter qrt_avg=train_2015.groupby(train_2015.index.quarter)[&quot;Sales&quot;].mean() #Groupby quarter qrt_table = pd.pivot_table(train_2015, index=train_2015.index.quarter, columns=train_2015.index.year) #add qrt_avg to qrt_table qrt_table[&quot;avg&quot;] = qrt_avg #Additive Seasonality Factor: Subtract mean from avg column qrt_table[&quot;additive&quot;] = qrt_table[&quot;avg&quot;]-avg_2015 #Multiplicative Seasonality Factor: Subtract mean from avg column qrt_table[&quot;multiplicative&quot;] = (qrt_table[&quot;avg&quot;]/avg_2015).round(2) qrt_table.index.name=&quot;Quarters&quot; qrt_table .

Observations: . Quarter plot &amp; heatmap confirm peak in Q3, drop in Q4. | For each of the years the upward trend observed in all quarters | Kenel Density plot shows data looks normally distributed, bi-modal distribution in quarters is because of small sample size. Peaks shift right from 2012 to 2015 indicating increase in average. | Distribution becomes fatter as the years progress, indicating higher spread/variation (as seen above in boxplot too) | Though The sales peak in Q3 each year, as a % of annual sales, all quarters contribute roughly the same | Seasonal factor analysis shows that in 3rd quarter we see that sales jump up by 15% (or $73K) relative to average while in other three quarters it drops by 1-7%. This is great for intuitive understanding of series behaviour. Another key takeaway from this analysis is that sales is not stable, as is evident from the charts above, multiplicative seasonality would capture the pattern better than additive seasonality. This insight will come handy when we create HW/ETS model (part 2). We could also reduce the variance by taking the log so errors are additive. | Decomposition . We will de-compose the time series into trend, seasonal and residuals . . Tip: Always use a semicolon (;) after plotting any results from statsmodels. For some reason if you don&#8217;t, it will print the plots twice. Also, by default the statsmodels plots are small and do not have a figsize() argument. Use rcParams() to define the plot size . decompose = seasonal_decompose(train[&quot;Sales&quot;]) decompose.plot(); plt.rcParams[&#39;figure.figsize&#39;] = (12, 8); . Observations: . Trend is more than linear, notice a small upward take off after 2013-07. Also notice that trend is projecting upward . | Seasonal pattern is consistent | Resduals are whetever is left after fitting the trend and seasonal components to the observed data. It&#39;s the component we cannot explain. We want the residuals to be i.i.d (i.e uncorrelated). If the residuals have a pattern, it means there is still some structural information left to be captured. Residuals are showing some wavy pattern, which is not good. Let&#39;s perform Ljung Box test to confirm if they are i.i.d as a group. | We do not want to see any recognizable patterns in the residuals, e.g. waves, upward/downward slope, funnel pattern etc. | ljung_p = np.mean(ljung(x=decompose.resid.dropna())[1]).round(3) print(&quot;Ljung Box, p value:&quot;, ljung_p, &quot;, Residuals are uncorrelated&quot; if ljung_p&gt;0.05 else &quot;, Residuals are correlated&quot;) . Ljung Box, p value: 0.184 , Residuals are uncorrelated . Residuals are uncorrelated. If the residuals are correlated, we can perform transformations to see if it stabilizes the variance. It&#39;s also an indication that we may need to use exogenous variable to fully explain the time series behaviour or use higher order models. In this case, the residuals are uncorrelated so that&#39;s good. . . Note: Ljung Box test tests the residuals as a group. Some residuals may have significant lag but as a group, we want to make sure they are uncorrelated. . Second Order Properties of the time series . We study the second order properties to understand - . is the data stationary | is the data white noise, random walk? i.e are the lags correlated? | quantify seasonal/cyclic behviour | . Stationarity: . For the series to be stationary, it must have: . constant mean | constant variance | constant covariance (uncorrelated) | . We verify this by observing change in mean, variance, autocorrelation and with a statistical test (ADFuller test) . Is the mean constant? . train.plot(figsize=(12,6), legend=True, label=&quot;Train&quot;, cmap=&#39;gray&#39;) train[&quot;Sales&quot;].rolling(4, center=False).mean().plot(legend=True, label=&quot;Rolling Mean 4Q&quot;); print(&quot;Mean is:&quot;, train[&quot;Sales&quot;].mean()) . Mean is: 496.5 . Notice that each year, the difference between the mean and the max in Q3 increases. This can potentially mean multiplicative seasonality. . Is the variance constant? . train[&quot;Sales&quot;].rolling(4).std().plot(legend=True, label=&quot;Rolling Std Deviation 4Q&quot;); print(&quot;S.D is:&quot;, train[&quot;Sales&quot;].std().round(1)) . S.D is: 110.9 . Both mean and standard deviation are increasing, thus not stationary. . Coefficient of Variation: . Coefficient of variation gives us an idea about the variability in the process, especially when looking at sales and demand. Note that this should be used for relative comparison and does not have a strict statistical defition. It&#39;s very common measure in demand planning and inventory analytics. . c.v = s.d/mean . If C.V&lt;0.75 =&gt; Low Variability . If 0.75&lt;C.V&lt;1.3 =&gt; Medium Variability .

Is the covariance constant? . #Plot ACF and PACF using statsmodels plot_acf(train); plot_pacf(train); . ADFuller Test for stationarity . Augmented Dicky Fuller test is a statistical test for stionarity. If the p value is less than 0.05, the series is stationary, otherwise non-stationary.

Observations: . ACF: ACF plot shows autocorrelation coeff is insignificant at all lag values (within the blue 95%CI band), except lag 1. When studying ACF plots, we look at these 4 things Are any lags significant, i.e outside the blue band of 95% CI. If they are, the series is correlated with itself at those lags. Note there is 5% chance that the lag shown as insignificant (ACF=0) is shows as significant. In our case, 1st lag is barely significant, indicating sales last quarter affect the sales this quarter. | How quickly do the bar lenghts change: If the bars are taping down, that shows presence of trend. Our series has a trend | Pattern: If the ACF shows up/down repeating pattern, it means seasonality with size equal to length of repetition. | Sign of ACF: Alternating signs in ACF shows mean-reversing process whereas if all the ACs are positive (or negative), it shows momentum process. | . | Properties of ACF help us determine the order of the MA process. More on that in part 2. . PACF: Partial autocorrelation, similar to partial correlation, shows correlation after &#39;partialing out&#39; previous lags. If a series has PACF significant at lag k, it means controlling for other lags &lt;k, lag k has a significant correlation. PACF plot is used to determine order of AR process. . | ADFuller test shows that the series is not stationary. We can try to make it stationary by differencing it. . | #De-trending de_trended = train.diff(1).dropna() adf2 = adfuller(de_trended)[1] print(f&quot;p value:{adf2}&quot;, &quot;, Series is Stationary&quot; if adf2 &lt;0.05 else &quot;, Series is Non-Stationary&quot;) de_trended.plot(); . p value:1.544700848240804e-18 , Series is Stationary . By taking the first difference we de-trended the series and it has become stationary! . Autocovariance function vs autocorrelation fucntion The autocovariance measures the linear dependence between two points on the same series observed at different times. Very smooth series exhibit autocovariance functions that stay large even when the t and s are far apart, whereas choppy series tend to have autocovariance functions that are nearly zero for large separations. autocorrelation functions (ACF) measures the predictability (linear), and is the normalized autocovariance. ACF, just like a correlation coeff, is between [-1,1] and is easier to interprete. Both measure linear dependence between random variables. . For example, the scatterplot below shows the train[&quot;Sales&quot;] plotted against it&#39;s first lag. We can see a linear, although weak, relationship between them. Use pandas.plotting.lag_plot() . Lag plot, 1st lag . pd.plotting.lag_plot(train[&quot;Sales&quot;],1); . Lag plot, 2nd lag : Weak relationship . pd.plotting.lag_plot(train[&quot;Sales&quot;],2); . . Note: If you wish to study the lags, you can obtain it by .shift() method. . sns.scatterplot(train[&quot;Sales&quot;], train[&quot;Sales&quot;].shift(-1)); . . Important: Use statsmodels for calculating ACF and NOT pandas pd.Series.autocorr() . Statsmodels and R use mean differencing, i.e subtract the mean of the entire series before summing it up, whereas Pandas uses Pearson correlation to calculate the ACF. Pearson correlation uses mean of the subseries rather than the entire series. For a long time series, the difference between the two should be negligible but for a short series, the diffrenece could be significant. In most cases, we are more interested in the pattern in the ACF than the actual values so, in a practical sense either would work. But, to be consistent and accurate use statsmodels to calculate and plot the ACF. . Which frequencies are prominent? . We typically look at the time series in the time domain. But, we can also analyze the time series in the frequency domain. It&#39;s based on the assumption that it is made up of sine and cosine waves of different frequencies. This helps us detect periodic component of known/unknown frequencies. It can show additional details of the time series that can be easily missed. We do it with a Periodogram and Power Spectral Density plot. . Periodogram: We analyze frequency and associated intensity of frequency. Note that below I have invrted the frequency to obtain periods Period,T = 1/frequency. For example, a monthly time series has 12 seasonal periods, so we would obtain frequency = 1/12 = 0.0833. In our example, we expect to see the intensity to be high at period=4 . . Tip: Periodogram should be plotted for a de-trended time series. Time series can be obtained by differencing the series . plot_pgram(train[&quot;Sales&quot;],1); . Power Spectral Density: Periodogram assumes the frequencies to be harmonics of the fundamental frequency, whereas PSD allows the frequency to vary contunuously. PSD is calculated using autocovariance function (ACF seen above). Spectral density is the amount of variance per frequency interval. PSD shows the eaxct same information of the time series as the ACF, just in the frequency domain. We rarely use PSD for business time series analysis. Plot below shows that lower frequency content dominates the time series. If it had another bump at higher frequency, that would indicate cyclic behaviour. Sometime it can be easier to figure out MA vs AR process by looking at the PSD plot. . #Plot PSD plt.psd(train[&quot;Sales&quot;], detrend=&#39;linear&#39;); plt.title(&quot;PSD Plot&quot;); . Is the series Normal? . As mentioned above, series does not have to be Gaussian for accurate forecasting but if the data is highly skewed it can affect the model selection and forecast uncertainty. In general, if the series is non-gaussian, it should be normalized before any further transformations (differencing, log, Box Cox) at least to check if normalization helps. Normalization will also help if decide to use regression, tree-based models, NN models later. Note that with normalization, we make the z score between [0,1], with standardization on the other hand , we center the distribution with mean =0, s.d.=1. . Normality can be checked visually by plotting the density plot, q-q plot and Shapiro-Wilk test. . #Distribution Plot sns.distplot(train[&quot;Sales&quot;]); . #Q-Q Plot sm.qqplot(train[&quot;Sales&quot;], fit=True, line=&#39;45&#39;, alpha=0.5, dist=&#39;norm&#39; ); . #Jarque Bera Stastical Test for Normality from scipy.stats import jarque_bera as jb is_norm=jb(train[&quot;Sales&quot;])[1] print(f&quot;p value:{is_norm.round(2)}&quot;, &quot;, Series is Normal&quot; if is_norm &gt;0.05 else &quot;, Series is Non-Normal&quot;) . p value:0.59 , Series is Normal . Observations: . Q-Q plot shows the data follows the 45deg line very closely, deviates slightly in the left tail. | Jarque Bera test shows the data is from Normal distribution | Summary . Model explainability is as important as model accuracy. We will keep above insights in mind when choosing, fitting, evaluating and selecting various models. We will choose the model that we can explain based on above insights. It is important to be able to explain the time series behavour in qualitative and quantitative terms. . In Part 2, I will cover model fitting, selection and ensemble forecasting . EDA in R . Forecasting Principles and Practice by Prof. Hyndmand and Prof. Athanasapoulos is the best and most practical book on time series analysis. Most of the concepts discussed in this blog are from this book. Below is code to run the forecast() and fpp2() libraries in Python notebook using rpy2 . import rpy2 import warnings warnings.filterwarnings(&#39;ignore&#39;) from rpy2.robjects import pandas2ri import rpy2.rinterface as rinterface pandas2ri.activate() %load_ext rpy2.ipython . %%R -i data,train -o r_train library(fpp2) r_train &lt;- ts(train$Sales, start=c(2012,01), frequency=4) r_train %&gt;% autoplot() + ggtitle(&quot;French Retail&quot;) +xlab(&quot;Year-Quarter&quot;)+ylab(&quot;Retail Sales&quot;) . %Rpush r_train . %%R -i r_train r_train %&gt;% ggsubseriesplot() . Lag Plots . %%R r_train %&gt;% gglagplot() . ACF Plots . %%R r_train %&gt;% ggAcf() . R shows 3 lags to be significant, whereas in Python we saw only the first lag to be significant. I am not sure why. Just to confirm, I am did the analysis in JMP statistical software which I use at work for statistical analysis. Below are the results. It matches with Python&#39;s results - 1st lag to be significant, spectral density plot matches too. . . Outlier detection . %%R -o olier olier &lt;- r_train %&gt;% tsoutliers() . print(olier, end=&quot;&quot;) . $index integer(0) $replacements numeric(0) . using tsoutliers() does not return any results, showing there are no statistical outliers . Summary . Here is a summary of what we have learned about this time series: . There are no null values, outliers or duplicate values in the series. Series is continuous, non-intermittent. No structural breaks. We don&#39;t have to do any cleaning. | Series has a trend. Sales have increased every year. It looks more than linear but less than exponential. We might need to try lof or BoxCox transform. | Series has seasonality with seasonal periods = 4. Peak in Q3, drops in Q4, ramps up from Q1 to Q3. No other dominant periods. No cyclic behaviour. | Avg sales per quarter is 497, and S.D is 111, low variability. We will use this to guage the model error relative to mean and S.D. | Since it is not a high-frequency data and has fixed seasonality, we can use ETS and SARIMA class of models | SARIMA could be used. We will need at least 1 differencing as de-trended series was stationary | Mean, variance, covariance are not constant. Series is not stationary, not white noise and not random-walk. | Variance increasing with time. Highs also look to be increasing relative to mean (rolling avg). &#39;multiplicative&#39; seasonality might fit better in ETS model | Series is normally distributed | 1st lag was significant, though barely (ACF~0.5) | We do not have any information on exogenous variables | As there are no outliers and series is not intermittent, we can use RSME for model evaluation | We never looked at the test data. All the EDA and model building must be done using the training set. Intuitively, given what we have observed in the training set, we expect the forecast to be on the upward trend with slightly mupltiplicative seasonality. | References: .

          "title": "About Me",
          "content": "(Last Updated Dec 2020) . My name is Sandeep Pawar. I am a Data Science professional, currently working at Cree Lighting as Simulation &amp; Data Analytics Engineer. I use engineering simulations, data analytics, Statistics, and Machine Learning to improve products and processes. . My background is in Mechanical Engineering &amp; Product Development. After graduating with an M.S in Mechanical Engineering, I worked as research engineer focused on using engineering simulation tools (Finite Element Analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics) to analyze products. I am co-inventor of 4 patents related to thermal management of lighting fixtures. For 10+ years, I worked in a cross-disciplinary team of engineers to analyze structural and thermal performance of industrial and semiconductor products. I used to design physical tests using DOE, gather data, analyze it, create simulation models and recommend design changes to the product engineers. Now as a Data Science professional, I do the same thing but with different tools and data. . I pivoted to Data Science ~4 years ago (2016) after I helped solve a business challenge using Statistics and Data Analytics. It energized me so much that I pursued my second Master’s in Engineering Management at Northwestern University with focus on Organizational Analytics. I learned how to use analytics to gain business insights. As an engineer I understand System Dynamics , and hence focus on creating sustainable solutions rather than quick band-aid fixes. . I am a passionate learner and am always learning something new. I love to challenge myself to learn new techniques, methods, tools and apply them in different settings. The business challenge I mentioned above? I used some of the Statistical methods I had used in my engineering research (Monte Carlo Simulation, uncertainty estimation) to solve it. I was given Employee Recognition Award (twice) for helping solve the issue. In 2015, I participated in a Business Strategy competition organized by Navigant Consulting. In that competition, the participants were asked to analyze market for a new diabetes drug and advise the company on ‘Go-No Go’ strategy. I had no prior experience of any of it. I did research on drug markets, how clinical trials work, learned how to create Complex Real Options, incorporate various risk in drug/financial valuations and presented a business strategy. I won the first prize in that competition. Not bragging, I am just proud of my efforts. One of the judges thought that I had been doing this for many years! I bring the same rigor and passion to all the projects I work on. I may not know everything but you can count on me learning and excelling. I am a proponent of open source and love sharing what I learn. . I enjoy watching cricket and making espressos &amp; latte art. I can make a heart, tulip &amp; rose. Learning to make a swan :) (If you have a favorite coffee blend or local espresso bar, send me a note). Since you asked, my favorite beans are Epic Espresso by 49th Parallel and favorite cafe is Espresso Cielo in Santa Monica, CA. I am a die-hard Sachin Tendulkar fan. . . Volunteering: I volunteer at Elmhurst Art Museum, a local non-profit that showcases artwork of local and international artists and helps educate local community about art. I help them with their data analytics needs to improve community outreach and marketing. I am always looking for volunteering opportunities so feel free to get in touch with me if I can be of any help. . Education: .
